From Compton to All England Club It doesn’t seem all that long ago that were were hearing about two sisters out of Compton, California who were going to reshape the landscape of women’s tennis. With their beaded hair and massive serves, they came leaping on to the WTP scene and didn’t let go for almost three decades. Serena made her professional debut in 1995 at the Bell Challenge in Quebec, before sitting back and letting her game and her body develop for the professional ranks. In 1997, she returned to the professional circuit and had some stunning wins over some of the top players in the world as a 16 years old. She would win her first tournament two years later at the Evert Cup, and then later that year captured her first Grand Slam which came at Flushing Meadows at the US Open . She took down Martina Hingis in the final and announced her presence on one of tennis’ biggest stages. Wimbledon breakthrough in 2002 She would have to wait for almost three years before she would reach the pinnacle of the tennis world again. When she returned, there was absolutely no stopping her.

Now the postseason begins, but the path to the Super Bowl can be confusing if you’re following along for the first time. Though a couple of top contenders from last season are noticeably absent (where’d the Rams go?), many familiar faces and franchises are back to battle for the Lombardi Trophy. But how many teams qualify for the postseason? How did they get here? How did the league determine the seeds and where the games will be played? Advertisement If you’re looking for answers to all of the above or if you just need a refresher before the final few weeks of the NFL season, we’ve got you covered. How many teams make the playoffs? Fourteen of the league’s 32 teams qualify for the postseason: seven from the American Football Conference and seven from the National Football Conference. Before the 2020 regular season, 12 teams made the postseason. Team owners voted to expand the playoffs to 14 in March 2020. GO DEEPER NFL Power Rankings: Bengals, Chiefs among teams riding hot streaks entering playoffs How do teams qualify for the playoffs? The first four playoff spots in each conference are awarded to the teams that finish with the best record in each division (North, South, East and West). The remaining six spots (three from the AFC and three from the NFC) are given to the teams with the best record who did not win their division. How are teams seeded at the beginning of the postseason? The division champions are seeded in order of win percentages.\", '24, 2023 | 2:00 PM EDT Only six NFL teams that have started 0-3 made the playoffs in the Super Bowl era (since 1966). Usually, most teams that lose the first three games are bad and not legitimate candidates to reach the postseason. However, there are a few rare examples of teams finding their way to the playoffs after such a start. One of the six teams was the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the strike-shortened 1982 season. Tampa Bay finished 5-4 after a 0-3 start, but the playoffs were expanded from 10 to 16 teams because of the strike. Thus, we will not include the Buccaneers in our look at 0–3 teams to make the playoffs. Which NFL Teams Have Made Playoffs After a 0–3 Start? 1981 New York Jets: Finished 10-5-1, qualified as AFC Wild Card team 1992 San Diego Chargers: Finished 11-5, won AFC West 1995 Detroit Lions: Finished 10-6, qualified as NFC Wild Card team 1998 Buffalo Bills: Finished 10-6, qualified as AFC Wild Card team 2018 Houston Texans: Finished 11-5, won AFC South What Is the Common Thread Between the 5 Teams? All five of the teams won at least five games in a row after starting 0-3. The 2018 Texans won nine straight games after losing the first three. The 1992 Chargers and the 1995 Lions each had seven-game win streaks during their respective seasons. Four of the five teams did not lose consecutive games the rest of the season. The 1992 Chargers lost only one of the last 12 games. The 1995 Lions were the only team to lose consecutive games after a 0-3 start.

      "[INFO] Query: how many stanley cups have the boston bruins won?...\n",
      "[INFO] Chunks: ['via Getty Images By Stephen Smith June 10, 2019 The Boston Bruins claimed their first Stanley Cup in Montreal on a Saturday night in March 1929, sweeping aside the mighty Canadiens. Back home, a crowd of 3,000 met the team’s train at North Station. Then again, the series with Montreal was only a semi-final. Any doubts to their hold on the trophy were put to rest six days later, when the Bruins definitively won the Cup, conquering the Rangers in New York. Two Stanley Cups in a week? It’s complicated. And it’s not something that is reflected in the records, either: Those distinctly show that the Bruins have won six championships (so far), not seven. And yet 90 years before the Bruins were attempting to win this year’s Cup finals and extend a run of Boston-area pro sports dominance , a brief confusion in the hockey continuum seemed to present the Bruins, at least by some accounts, with the opportunity for a one-of-a-kind Stanley Cup double. The 1928-29 season was a banner year for the 12-year-old N.H.L. From just four teams in the 1923-24 season, the league had spread to 10 cities, six in the United States. Overall attendance was up by 22 percent from the previous season, with the Bruins rated the biggest draw. They were the first American team to join the N.H.L., bankrolled by the grocery magnate Charles Adams. His first hire in 1924 was Art Ross, a 38-year-old Montrealer with a reputation as a genius of hockey strategy and innovation who had also won two Stanley Cups earlier as a player. First awarded in 1893 by Lord Stanley, Canada’s governor-general, hockey’s most coveted prize was, originally, a challenge cup intended to reward the best Canadian team, regardless of league. From 1918 on, however, the Stanley Cup', 'by Jamie Being the first American team to join the NHL in 1924, the Boston Bruins have had nearly 100 years to establish their success as a franchise. The Bruins have hosted the likes of hockey legends such as defenseman Bobby Orr, goalie Tuukka Rask and forward Patrice Bergeron. The hockey culture in Boston is long-standing, and New Englanders are passionate about their Bruins. With such a long history, how many Stanley Cups have the Boston Bruins won? The Boston Bruins have won 6 Stanley Cups in their nearly millennium-long history. Their first Cup came in 1929, with two more added in 1939 and 1941. They won two more in 1970 and 1972, winning their most recent in 2011. Stanley Cup Finals 1929: Boston Bruins vs New York Rangers Not having to wait long to find success in the NHL, the Bruins were able to capture their first Stanley Cup just 5 years after their inception into the league. Because the early Cup Finals had different rules, the Bruins were able to defeat the Rangers in just 2 games. Goalkeeper Tiny Thompson managed a shutout in the first game and allowed just one goal in the second. Boston was led by winger Harry Oliver, who had 1 goal and 1 assist in the series. Centers Dutch Gainor and Bill Carson both added a goal, with Boston’s final of 4 total goals coming from defenseman/winger Dit Clapper. See the Official NHL Shop of the Boston Bruins here for any fan gear you want! Stanley Cup Finals 1939: Boston Bruins vs Toronto Maple Leafs After winning their first Cup quite quickly, Boston fans had to wait another 10 years to celebrate their team winning another one. This time, the Bruins faced the Maple Leafs in a best-of-7 series. Boston center Bill Cowley', \"Bruins had another chance to win Lord Stanley’s Cup. Number Six is Sweet During the 2010-11 season, the Bruins finally won their sixth and most recent championship. Fittingly, they knocked off the Canadiens in the first round of the playoffs, surviving a tight, seven-game series. After sweeping the Flyers in the next round, Boston had to endure a seven-game series with the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Conference Finals. That was followed by a seven-game series in the Stanley Cup Finals with the Vancouver Canucks. After losing Game 2 in overtime, the Bruins were behind 2-0 in the series. But the Bruins won the next two games, 8-1 and 4-0, to even the series. Ultimately, the series was tied 3-3, with the home team winning every game. However, the Bruins broke that streak with a convincing 4-0 Game 7 win in Vancouver, bringing the Stanley Cup back to Boston after a nearly 40-year wait. Unfortunately, the Bruins came up short two years later, losing to the Blackhawks in the Stanley Cup Finals. However, the quest continues for Boston’s seventh Stanley Cup victory. Questions?

The hosts are placed seventh going into the game, having amassed 36 points while the visitors are 14th with 25 points. Marseille are chasing for another season in the Champions League after missing out this season. Recently appointed Jean-Louis Gasset has engineered a good run at the team after taking over from Genarro Gattuso.

Man Utd 0 Newcastle 3 (Willock 60) Joe Willock puts Newcastle into the quarter-finals with another fine goal! It was totally against the run of play but Newcastle won’t care one bit. Joelinton made a fine tackle on Amrabat in the centre circle, with Willock collecting the loose ball. He charged straight at the heart of the defence, all the way to edge of the United area. Gordon blocked off Maguire and that allowed Willock to hammer a low shot into the bottom corner. Onana had no chance.

Willock’s 65th-minute header, his third goal of the season, and a second from substitute Wilson two minutes from time inflicted just a second defeat in 17 games in all competitions on Erik ten Hag ’s side and gained a measure of revenge for February’s Carabao Cup final heartache at Wembley. It was a deserved 2-0 victory too for the Magpies, who created the better chances in the game and might have gone ahead through Alexander Isak, Sean Longstaff and Willock before they broke the deadlock in front of a crowd of 52,268.

The context: Even viewed as a percentage, it could be argued that the comparison between Ascari\\'s eight-race season (one of which was the Indy 500 that he didn\\'t compete in, raising his true percentage to 87.5%) and Verstappen\\'s 22-race season is pretty tenuous. A more modern example -- that just so happens to be third on the list of highest win percentages in a season -- is Michael Schumacher\\'s 72.22% from 2004, which saw him win 13 of the 18 races that year. Verstappen was crowned 2023 champion in Qatar. Photo by Michael Potts/BSR Agency/Getty Images Points The record: Max Verstappen scored 575 of the 620 points on offer in 2023 -- another new record that eclipses the 454 points he scored last year and the previous record of 413 held by Lewis Hamilton from 2019. The context: Given the changes to the points system over the years and the growing calendar (including the addition of points-scoring sprint races) the number \"575\" doesn\\'t mean a huge amount. However, when you consider Verstappen scored 92.74% of the points on offer, it helps to underline the level of his dominance in a historical context. What\\'s more, Verstappen scored over double the points of teammate Sergio Pérez (284), who finished second in the drivers\\' championship, and 166 more than the Mercedes team as a whole, which finished second to Red Bull in the constructors\\' championship. Added to that, Verstappen\\'s tally at the Belgian Grand Prix in July (before F1\\'s summer break) would have been enough to secure this year\\'s title.

How far up the wins list can he climb this year? Red Bull’s Max Verstappen earned his 10th win in the last 12 Formula 1 races two Sundays at Bahrain International Circuit, winning the Bahrain Grand Prix for the first time in his career to open up a season on top of the podium for the first time in his career, The win was the 36th victory of the 25-year-old Dutchman’s career, which is good for sixth place on the all-time wins list. After the race, Mercedes’ George Russell, who finished in seventh place, stated that he feels Red Bull and the RB19 are going to win all 23 races on the 2023 schedule, given the performance they showed in Bahrain. Ironically, the opening race weekend of the 2023 Formula 1 season was one in which many believed the Red Bull wasn’t even as good as it could have been. Last year in the RB18, Verstappen broke the all-time single season record with 15 victories. The previous record had been shared by Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel, who won 13 races in 2004 and 2013, respectively.

The band recorded several albums, achieving worldwide success with The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), and The Wall (1979). In 1985, Waters declared Pink Floyd \"a spent force,\" but the remaining members, led by Gilmour, continued recording and touring under the name Pink Floyd. Although they were unsuccessfully sued by Waters for rights to the name, they again enjoyed worldwide success with A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987), and The Division Bell (1994). Eventually they reached a settlement out of court with Waters allowing them use of the name.

      "[INFO] Chunks: ['(the melting face), Led Zeppelin’s In Through the Out Door , Wings’ Band on the Run , as well as most of Pink Floyd’s albums, including Meddle and Animals . The Beginning of the End for Pink Floyd Pink Floyd on tour in March 1973. John Lynn Kirk/Redferns/Getty Images Dark Side of the Moon sent Pink Floyd into orbit. The band became something resembling a machine, crafting subsequent albums — notably The Wall — and touring intensively but growing apart in the process. Waters nudged Wright to leave, and it became Waters, the other guys, and session musicians. These days, Waters even downplays the contributions of his fellow bandmates and engineer Alan Parsons, who weaved some mighty sonic magic at the mixing boards. Pink Floyd never again felt this cohesive as a band, nor did any subsequent album hang together as cohesively as Dark Side of the Moon . Some fans might make the case for The Wall , but it grows ponderous and is too long by several songs. Children of The Dark Side Roger Waters in May 1973. David Warner Ellis/Redferns/Getty Images It’s easy to name bands and performers influenced by The Dark Side of the Moon . Look no further than Radiohead , The Flaming Lips, Tame Impala, Tool, and early Coldplay , not to mention the many, many Pink Floyd cover band that have earned their money playing “Money.” But the influence of Dark Side extends far beyond that (or any tribute albums, collectors’ editions, etc.). It’s very likely that you’ve worn, or still wear, a Dark Side T-shirt. Your kid might, too. Hell, people who’ve never listened to a note on the album recognized its cover, or have heard about the supposed connections to The Wizard of Oz . Also, back in 2020, the Dark', 'Studios between May 1972 and January 1973, and having been developed and rehearsed during a series of live performances in the months preceding, “The Dark Side of the Moon” is the ultimate expression of Pink Floyd’s sonic artistry – an Olympian psychedelic concept album that, despite being very much of its time, still retains the ability the dazzle and astound in the digital age. Lyric writer, bassist and principal architect Roger Waters deserves much of the credit for its record-breaking success, as do bandmates David Gilmour (vocals and guitar), Nick Mason (drums) and Richard Wright (keyboards and vocals), who were all similarly at the top of their game. “There was something about the symbiosis of the musical talents of the four of us that worked really well,” Waters told Billboard in 2006, looking back on the record. The ground-breaking work of engineer Alan Parsons meanwhile, can be heard in the myriad of tape loops and then-revolutionary effects that run throughout the album’s hypnotic grooves. Trending on Billboard A landmark record in every respect, including its now iconic prism sleeve (courtesy of Storm Thorgerson), “The Dark Side of the Moon,” which was the band’s eighth studio album, transformed Pink Floyd from ambitious art-house hipsters to international superstars, while influencing virtually every rock band of the past forty years. It also famously inspired an unsubstantiated theory about the album’s deliberate synchronicity with “The Wizard of Oz.” But the album needed no help to imbue listeners with inner visions. Here’s our exploratory, mind-warping journey through the deepest reaches of each song on Floyd’s 1973 studio masterpiece. “Speak To Me” “Speak To Me” and “Breathe (In The Air)” Beginning with the gradual fade-in of a synthesized heartbeat, “The Dark Side Of The Moon’s” 90-second long opening instrumental collage perfectly sets the tone for the', 'the Daily Telegraph has reported the singer secured a cash payment with Pink Floyd and their label, EMI. ^ \"The Dark Side Of The Moon\" vinyl gatefold / booklet v t e Pink Floyd David Gilmour Nick Mason Syd Barrett Bob Klose Roger Waters Richard Wright Studio albums The Piper at the Gates of Dawn A Saucerful of Secrets More Ummagumma Atom Heart Mother Meddle Obscured by Clouds The Dark Side of the Moon Wish You Were Here Animals The Wall The Final Cut A Momentary Lapse of Reason The Division Bell The Endless River Live albums Ummagumma Delicate Sound of Thunder Pulse London \\'66–\\'67 Is There Anybody Out There?

While Macca wasn’t thrilled about taking on the bass role, he understood that he needed to do it. “So it was like oh-oh, we haven’t got a bass player. And everyone sort of turned round and looked at me. I was a bit lumbered with it, really. It was like, well, it better be you then. I don’t think you could have caught John doing it—I don’t think he would have done it. ‘No, you’re kidding.

There’s no denying that Paul McCartney is the most famous bassist in a band ever. Many bassists go unrecognized, but Paul McCartney changed that by being a pivotal member of The Beatles. However, the “Let it Be” singer initially didn’t want to be the bassist and only took on the role when no one else could fill the slot. Stu Sutcliffe was the original bass guitarist for The Beatles Paul McCartney | David Redfern/Redferns Stuart “Stu” Sutcliffe was the original bassist for The Beatles. While his time with the band wasn’t long, he did have a lasting impact as he is credited with coming up with the name “Beetles,” along with John Lennon. In an interview with Reverb , Paul McCartney said Sutcliffe initially wanted to go to art school, and he won a painting competition that awarded him 75 quid. The Beatles convinced him to buy a bass guitar with that money, and he eventually became the bassist since none of the others could afford to play bass nor wanted to. “Stu was suddenly there just because he could afford the bass, and none of us could,” McCartney explained. “None of us wanted to be the bass player.

If at times it might have felt a touch challenging, it was all to the good of the record that was being created. What emerged, on September 15, 2010, was Maroon 5’s catchiest pop collection to date. The strident funk and rock hybrid tone of the previous album – already an evolution from the band’s rockier debut – had been freshly illuminated by a high-energy pop sheen that drew references from Lange’s 80s and 90s heyday, while remaining sharp and contemporary. Maroon 5 - Misery (Official Music Video) Watch this video on YouTube Click to load video The album’s first single was “Misery,” a collaboration between Levine, guitarist Jesse Carmichael and long-time collaborator Sam Farrar, who was now increasingly working with the band. Hitting radio in June 2010, in advance of Hands All Over ’s release, the track received a critical thumbs-up and, alongside a video featuring another one of Maroon 5’s provocative but tongue-in-cheek storylines, started its ascent up the charts. Its subsequent, inexplicable stalling outside the US Top 10 (at No.14) and a peak of No.30 in the UK seemed at odds with the song’s obvious commercial direction. A later nomination at the following year’s Grammys for Best Pop Performance By A Duo Or Group With A Vocal would give the song the credit it deserved, but it set the Hands All Over campaign off on a shakier footing than had been expected. However, reviews for the album were generally stronger than those that had initially greeted It Won’t Be Soon Before Long . It was as if the critics were finally warming up to Maroon 5’s potent songwriting power.

Back then, and for many years afterwards, Crosby was addicted to alcohol, cocaine and heroin. As he has often pointed out, it’s a miracle that he’s alive. “I expected to be dead when I was about 30. Hehehehe!” His high-pitched giggle is surprising – as is so much about him. Crosby’s life story would make an incredible, if possibly unbelievable, movie. He grew up in Los Angeles, the privileged son of the Oscar-winning cinematographer Floyd Crosby. His mother doted on him, his father was as cold as he was brilliant. He flunked school, briefly studied drama then pursued a career in music. Crosby had huge success with two seminal bands. The Byrds pretty much invented folk rock in the 1960s with their jingly-jangly pop (covers of Bob Dylan’s Mr Tambourine Man and Pete Seeger’s Turn! Turn! Turn! were No 1 hits). After Crosby was sacked from the Byrds, he joined forces with Graham Nash from the Hollies and Stephen Stills from Buffalo Springfield to form Crosby, Stills & Nash (CSN), one of the first supergroups. With Neil Young , they became a super-supergroup. All four were exceptional singer-songwriters, their harmonies as gorgeous as they were intricate, and, when they wanted to, they could rock with the best of them. Their first two albums, the eponymous debut and (with Young) Déjà Vu, sold millions and produced any number of classic songs including Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, Our House, Helpless, Marrakesh Express, Guinnevere, Long Time Gone and Almost Cut My Hair (the last three written by Crosby). Both the Byrds and CSN have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. View image in fullscreen']...\n"

By Matthew Frankel, CFP – Updated Dec 6, 2023 at 10:30AM The price-to-earnings ratio, also known as the P/E ratio, is one of the most commonly used stock valuation metrics, and it is important for any investor to understand. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at what the P/E ratio is, how to calculate it, and how to use it as part of your investment analysis. Image source: The Motley Fool Understanding the P/E ratio Understanding the P/E ratio The P/E ratio, or price-to-earnings ratio, is a metric that compares a company’s net income to its stock price. It can be an excellent tool when analyzing stocks and can help investors get a sense of whether a stock is a good value or expensive. As the name implies, the P/E ratio is calculated by taking the current share price of a stock and dividing by its earnings per share over a one-year period. For example, if a stock trades for $40 per share and earned $2 per share in the past year, its P/E ratio would be 20. You may hear the P/E ratio also referred to as the P/E multiple or earnings multiple, and it’s important to realize that these terms are often used interchangeably and mean the same thing. There are several different ways to calculate the P/E ratio, with the two most common being the trailing P/E and the forward P/E. A stock’s trailing P/E is calculated by using its past four quarters’ earnings, while the forward P/E is calculated by using the consensus projections, or the company’s own guidance, for the next 12 months of earnings. Why is it important?', \"In some countries, like Japan, it can be a lot less. In most countries, the difference is not so extreme, but it is still there. So P/E ratios tend to be higher than they would be if we were using net earnings instead of reported earnings. P/E ratio stands for the price to earnings ratio. Many people in the stock market use P/E because it shows how much you are paying for a dollar of profit. How is PE Ratio calculated? The PE ratio is calculated by dividing the market price of a share by its earnings per share. The result is then multiplied by 100. A PE ratio of 8, for example, means that for every rupee of profit earned by the company, the shares are being sold at 8 rupees. A PE ratio of 15 means it's being sold at 15 rupees for every rupee of profit. E.g., if the PE Ratio of TCS is ten, it means that the current market price of TCS is ten times its EPS. The PE ratio of a company tells us at what price investors are buying or selling the company's shares. The higher the PE ratio of a company, the more expensive it is for investors to buy shares, so you can say that if the PE ratio of a company increases, then the value of its shares will also increase. On the other hand, if the PE ratio of a company decreases, then its share value will also decrease because investors are finding it cheaper to purchase more shares, given that they are paying less money for each share. How to determine the PE Ratio? There are two ways to find out what the PE ratio is. You can look it up in a reference book, or you can\", \"How To Understand The P/E Ratio Rob Berger Editor Published: May 4, 2022, 9:59am Editorial Note: Forbes Advisor may earn a commission on sales made from partner links on this page, but that doesn't affect our editors' opinions or evaluations. The price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio, helps you compare the price of a company’s stock to the earnings the company generates. This comparison helps you understand whether markets are overvaluing or undervaluing a stock. The P/E ratio is a key tool to help you compare the valuations of individual stocks or entire stock indexes, such as the S&P 500. In this article, we’ll explore the P/E ratio in depth, learn how to calculate a P/E ratio, and understand how it can help you make sound investment decisions. What Is the P/E Ratio? The P/E ratio is derived by dividing the price of a stock by the stock’s earnings. Think of it this way: The market price of a stock tells you how much people are willing to pay to own the shares, but the P/E ratio tells you whether the price accurately reflects the company’s earnings potential, or it’s value over time. If a company’s stock is trading at INR 100 per share, for example, and the company generates INR 4 per share in annual earnings, the P/E ratio of the company’s stock would be INR 25 (100 / 4). To put it another way, given the company’s current earnings, it would take 25 years of accumulated earnings to equal the cost of the investment. In addition to stocks, the P/E ratio is calculated for entire stock indexes. For example, the P/E ratio of the NIFTY 50 currently stands at 22.20 . Since prices fluctuate constantly, the P/E ratio of stocks and stock indexes never stand still. The P/E ratio\"]...\n"

The market cap is the value of all of the company’s stock combined, giving you a sense of what value investors are placing on the company based on the price it is trading at. Investing for Everyone As of February of 2023, Coca-Cola had a market cap of $259.46 billion whereas Pepsi had a market cap of $243.17 billion. These projections fluctuate.

      "[INFO] Chunks: ['\"the monthly dividend company.\" Realty Income has paid a dividend every month for over 600 consecutive months, and is now a Dividend Aristocrat. On rare occasions a company may issue what\\'s known as a special dividend. Often this is the result of a large asset sale or some other event that results in a large nonrecurring profit, while other companies use a special dividend to return extra money to shareholders every few years. A notable example is Costco Wholesale ( COST 0.07% ), which has paid substantial special dividends three times over the past decade, in addition to its regular quarterly dividend: COST Dividend data by YCharts Important dividend dates to know Important dividend dates to know There are three important dates to understand if you invest in any dividend stocks : The ex-dividend date is the first day a stock trades without the most recent dividend being factored into the share price. In other words, if you buy shares on or after this date, you will not get the next dividend the company is scheduled to pay. The payment date is the date a company will make the next dividend payment to shareholders. This may or may not be the date that the dividend arrives in your account; depending on the brokerage you use, there could be a delay of a day or more in getting your dividend payment. The payment date can range from just a few days to more than a month after the board of directors declares a dividend is coming. The record date is the date you must own shares on or before in order to be entitled to the dividend. When do you have to buy a stock to get paid the next dividend? When do you have to buy a stock to get', \"5, 2023. The company previously declared the dividend Feb. 19, 2023, and the record date was set as May 6, 2023. Only shareholders who had purchased the stock before the ex-date, therefore, are entitled to the cash payment. Other Considerations On average, a stock often will drop slightly less than the dividend amount. Given that stock prices move on a daily basis, the fluctuation caused by small dividends may be difficult to detect. The effect on stocks from larger dividend payments can be easier to observe. If a company issues a dividend in stock instead of cash or the cash dividend is 25% or more of the value of the stock, the ex-date rules slightly differ. With a stock or large cash dividend, the ex-date is set on the first business day after the dividend is paid. Key Dividend-Related Dates The ex-date is just one of the important dates in dividend distribution. Declaration date: Also known as the announcement date, this is the date when a company's board of directors announces the dividend distribution. This is an important moment: any change in the expected dividend can cause the stock to rise or fall quickly as traders adjust their expectations. The ex-date and record date will occur after the declaration date. Record date: This is when the company reviews who the shareholders of record are. The record date is one business day after the ex-date but shouldn't be a major factor in your decision of when to buy a stock. Payment date: This is when dividend checks are sent or credited to investor accounts. Since the payment date is known in advance, the event shouldn't have any impact on the stock price. Who Sets the Ex-Date? A record date is set first. Then, the ex-dividend date is set based on the\", \"or after the ex-dividend date , the seller of the stock keeps the dividend. Record Date (or Date of Record) This is the date that you must be on the company's books as a shareholder of record to receive the dividend. Payment Date This is the scheduled date on which a company will pay a declared dividend to shareholders of record. Hypothetical Example – Company ABC On August 15, Company ABC declares a dividend payable on September 28 to its shareholders. Details stipulate that shareholders of record on the company's books on or before September 6 are entitled to the dividend. The stock would go ex-dividend one business day before the record date. The table below puts it together with the key dates: Type Declaration Date Ex-Dividend Date Record Date Payment Date Date August 15 September 5 September 6 September 28 Note The date the dividend is announced The date before which you must own the stock to be entitled to the dividend. The date by which you must be on the company's books as a shareholder to receive the dividend. The date the dividend is paid to shareholders. Dividend Yield This is the percentage of return a company pays out annually in dividends relative to its share price. Not all companies pay a dividend, so the presence of a dividend yield on a stock quote screen can often be viewed positively - as only profitable companies tend to share their earnings. A stock's dividend yield is calculated by taking its annual dividend-per-share and then dividing it by the stock's current price. The result is then expressed as a percentage. The formula is: Dividend yield = annual dividend / stock price x 100 As an example, Company ABC pays an annual dividend of $1.44, and the stock is trading at\"]...\n"

However, if you only have room for one in your portfolio, you\\'ll need to know the better buy. Apple Apple shares are up by 274% over the last five years and 890% over the last decade. That growth has come alongside annual revenues, which have risen by 48% to $394 billion since 2018 while operating income increased by 68% to $119 billion. The company\\'s development over the years is owed mainly to the potency of its products and services, which has led it to achieve a leading 24% global market share in smartphones with the iPhone. Its market share has steadily grown from 11.7% in the first quarter of 2019. The company famously has created a \"walled garden\" of products, which includes smartphones, computers, tablets, smartwatches, and headphones, all of which are interconnected and all of which rely on its in-house operating systems. The interconnectivity of these devices gives users of Apple devices incentives to stay within its ecosystem when seeking out others devices and services. For instance, when an iPhone user needs a computer, they are far more likely to turn to Apple\\'s Mac lineup than its competitor\\'s, thanks to the connectivity\\'s ease of use. For this reason, Apple was the only company among its biggest competitors to experience growth in its PC business amid economic headwinds in Q3 2022, expanding by 40.2%.

That being said... MDMA (aka molly, ecstasy, E) has had something of an onscreen renaissance in recent years.

All of a sudden, characters left and right are poppin\\' molly like frat boys at a Tiësto concert, and the drug\\'s consumption is just as likely to yield an epic dance-off, a sweaty make-out, or a rapid-fire party montage as it is to serve as cautionary tale.

Friendly, uninhibited, and irresponsible in his blatant desire to be hip with his son, Scott goes so far as to encourage his two other children to experiment with Ecstasy, alcohol, marijuana, and LSD during an all-night party at his apartment. Eventually, Scott's ex-wife intervenes on behalf of the children and the viewer is witness to his downward spiral, including an arrest for drug possession, an ugly custody battle, and several emotionally draining family confrontations.

It is believed that Neeson will play the son of officer Frank Drebin , the character played in the original by Leslie Nielsen in the 80s comedy classic series. See full article at Collider.com 10/13/2022 by Christopher McPherson Collider.com Naked Gun Reboot With Liam Neeson Coming From Lonely Island\\'s Akiva Schaffer Nobody could possibly top the late comedy legend Leslie Nielsen and his performance in the classic 1988 film \" The Naked Gun ,\" but when has a little thing like that ever stopped this industry from trying anyway? With several recent legacy sequels and reboots proving successful at the box office in the post-pandemic landscape, Paramount is moving forward with yet another one of their own. Renowned among viewers of a certain vintage for its slapstick, laugh-a-minute joys that rival the likes of \" Airplane! \" or \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\" the original \" The Naked Gun \" is now being brought back with with actor Liam Neeson negotiating to star. This news comes courtesy of Deadline, which reports that \"The Lonely Island\" veteran Akiva Schaffer is on board to direct the project alongside screenwriters Dan Gregor and Doug Mand (\" Chip \\'n Dale: Rescue Rangers \"),', 'of \\'Naked Gun\\' Movies Dies at Age 84 By Bob Thomas , Andrew Dalton | Last Updated: August 15, 2012 LOS ANGELES – Leslie Nielsen, who traded in his dramatic persona for inspired bumbling as a hapless doctor in \"Airplane!\" and the accident-prone detective Frank Drebin in \"The Naked Gun\" comedies, died on Sunday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 84. The Canadian-born actor died from complications from pneumonia at a hospital near his home at 5:34 p.m., surrounded by his wife, Barbaree, and friends, his agent John S. Kelly said in a statement. \"We are saddened by the passing of beloved actor Leslie Nielsen, probably best remembered as Lt. Frank Drebin in \\'The Naked Gun\\' series of pictures, but who enjoyed a more than 60-year career in motion pictures and television,\" said Kelly. Nielsen came to Hollywood in the mid-1950s after performing in 150 live television dramas in New York. With a craggily handsome face, blond hair and 6-foot-2 height, he seemed ideal for a movie leading man. Nielsen first performed as the king of France in the Paramount operetta \"The Vagabond King\" with Kathryn Grayson. The film — he called it \"The Vagabond Turkey\" — flopped, but MGM signed him to a seven-year contract. His first film for that studio was auspicious — as the space ship commander in the science fiction classic \"Forbidden Planet.\" He found his best dramatic role as the captain of an overturned ocean liner in the 1972 disaster movie, \"The Poseidon Adventure.\" He became known as a serious actor, although behind the camera he was a prankster. That was an aspect of his personality never exploited, however, until \"Airplane!\" was released in 1980 and became a huge hit. As the doctor aboard a plane in which the pilots, and some of the passengers,', 'fans among the younger generation for inane non sequiturs delivered with a straight face. \"Can you fly this plane, and land it?\" he asks a passenger. \"Surely, you can\\'t be serious,\" comes the answer. \"I am serious. And don\\'t call me Shirley,\" Rumack replies. The Naked Gun franchise had its origins in the short-lived 1982 TV show Police Squad. After it was cancelled, creators Jim Abrahams, Jerry Zucker and David Zucker – who had previously worked with Nielsen on Airplane! – turned it into a feature packed with slapstick action and double entendres. Drebin beat up the Ayatollah Khomeini and scrubbed the birthmark from Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev\\'s head. The cast was rounded out by George Kennedy as Drebin\\'s partner, and OJ Simpson as their hapless colleague. In the 1991 sequel, Naked Gun 2-1/2: The Smell of Fear, the villain, played by Robert Goulet, tells an unannounced Drebin he did not see his name on the guestlist. \"Nothing to be embarrassed about. I sometimes go by my maiden name,\" Drebin replies. The final film, 1994\\'s The Naked Gun 33-1/3: The Final Insult saw Drebin try to avert a disaster during the Academy Awards and go undercover in a penitentiary.

      "[INFO] Chunks: ['Hollywood can muster to lure audiences back into theaters. After all, fewer experiences are better realized on the big screen than a sprawling battle sequence or explosive, stunt-packed chase scene. There may even come a time where movie theaters more or less exclusively exhibit action movies, while less extravagant fare heads straight to streaming. Whether that\\'s good news or terrible news probably depends on who\\'s being asked. From epic swashbucklers to the cream of the comic book crop, Stacker compiled data on all action movies to come up with a Stacker score—a weighted index split evenly between IMDb and Metacritic scores. To qualify, the film had to have an \"action\" listing on IMDb, a Metascore, and at least 5,000 votes. Ties were broken by Metascore, and further ties were broken by IMDb user ratings. All data is accurate as of Jan. 11, 2021. Starting with the great, counting down to the greater, and ending with the greatest, here are the 100 best action movies of all time. #100. 3:10 to Yuma (2007) - Director: James Mangold - Stacker score: 83.2 - Metascore: 76 - IMDb user rating: 7.7 - Runtime: 122 minutes An Elmore Leonard short story provided the basis for both a 1957 Western and this action-packed remake. Christian Bale plays rancher Dan Evans, who must escort wanted outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to justice. Many scenes were shot at New Mexico’s Bonanza Creek Ranch, which has been used for a number of classic Westerns. #99. King Kong (2005) - Director: Peter Jackson - Stacker score: 83.2 - Metascore: 81 - IMDb user rating: 7.2 - Runtime: 187 minutes Director Peter Jackson followed his acclaimed “Lord of the Rings” trilogy with yet another big-budget blockbuster.

The story traces draft after draft of the screenplay’s development, including screenwriter Howard Koch’s addition of Rick’s background as a gunrunner during the Spanish Civil War. Years later, Koch wrote a treatment for a sequel called Return to Casablanca , set in the 1960s, in which the son of Rick and Ilse—raised by Ilse and Victor Laszlo—visits the North African town where he was conceived the night his mother, gun in hand, demanded a letter of transport from his biological dad. The studios passed on Koch’s story, perhaps fearing that it would fare no better than the 1955 and 1983 TV versions of the classic film that had come and quickly gone.

Almost 35 million people watched the comedy unfold in the hospital, which featured a special guest appearance of Janice. 2. “The Last One” (Season 10, Episodes 17 and 18) Many people probably thought the series finale of Friends was the most watched episode for the series. However, it only comes in at number 2 with 52.46 million fans tuning in to watch Rachel get off the plane and Monica and Chandler becoming parents. The closing moment when the gang goes and gets their last cup of coffee still brings a tear to my eye. 1. “The One After the Super Bowl” (Season 2, Episodes 12 and 13) It is pretty clear that season two was the most watched of all the seasons of Friends. The two-part episode that aired after the Super Bowl in 1996 is the most watched episode for the classic comedy. 52.9 million people watched as Chandler hooked up with Julia Roberts, Joey was stalked Brooke Shields, and Monica and Rachel fought over Jean Claude Van Damme.

The series finale was NOT the show’s most watched episode. The Friends finale stands at #4 of the most watched series finales, behind M*A*S*H, Cheers and Seinfeld , but even with 52.5 million viewers, it still didn’t break its own record of 52.9 million viewers that “The One After The Superbowl” generated in 1996 . 9. Friends and former cast members were backstage during the final taping. Hank Azaria , Phoebe’s scientist boyfriend, was at the show’s final taping as was Courtney Cox’s then-husband, David Arquette, who filmed the cast backstage before the taping began. 10. Friends took a cue from Pearl Jam. If you’ve ever been to a Pearl Jam concert, chances are the last song of the night was “Yellow Ledbetter,” this isn’t always the case, but more often than not, it’s the band’s closing number. Which could be why showrunners , David Crane and Marta Kauffman, chose to use it in the finale’s second half when Rachel goes through the gate at the airport. This was also the first time the band had licensed out a song for a television show.

      "[INFO] Chunks: ['Science & Tech Key People: William Thomson, Baron Kelvin Hans Bethe Lev Davidovich Landau Lyman Spitzer James Prescott Joule (Show more) Related Topics: combustion geothermal energy solar energy wind power electric power (Show more) On the Web: Cal Poly Pomona - Energy and Energy Transfer - Content Background Document (Feb. 27, 2024) (Show more) See all related content → Top Questions What is energy? Energy is the capacity for doing work. It may exist in potential, kinetic, thermal, helectrical, chemical, nuclear, or other forms. What is the unit of measurement for energy? In the International System of Units (SI), energy is measured in joules . One joule is equal to the work done by a one-newton force acting over a one-meter distance. Can energy be created? Energy can be neither created nor destroyed. It can only be changed from one form to another. This principle is known as the conservation of energy . energy , in physics , the capacity for doing work . It may exist in potential , kinetic , thermal , electrical, chemical , nuclear , or other various forms. There are, moreover, heat and work—i.e., energy in the process of transfer from one body to another. After it has been transferred, energy is always designated according to its nature. Hence, heat transferred may become thermal energy, while work done may manifest itself in the form of mechanical energy . All forms of energy are associated with motion . For example, any given body has kinetic energy if it is in motion. A tensioned device such as a bow or spring , though at rest, has the potential for creating motion; it contains potential energy because of its configuration. Similarly, nuclear energy is potential energy because it results from the configuration of subatomic particles in the nucleus', '& Advocacy › Reports & Studies › POPA Reports › Background Papers on Energy › Energy Units Energy Units Introduction Many sorts of units are used in energy discussions. They fall into two broad categories: (a) those whose definition is not related to a particular fuel, which we here term \"basic\" units; and (b) those whose definition is related to idealized properties of a specific fuel, which we here term \"source-based\" units. These units, along with special topics related to electricity, are discussed in succeeding sections. Table 1 gives conversion factors between units, as well as the energy content of specific fuels. Basic Units Joule (J). This is the basic energy unit of the metric system, or in a later more comprehensive formulation, the International System of Units (SI). It is ultimately defined in terms of the meter, kilogram, and second. Calorie (cal). Historically the calorie was defined in terms of the heating of water. Thus, in a traditional definition, one calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1°C, from 14.5 °C to 15.5 °C. (This is sometimes referred to as the 15 °C calorie, and differs slightly from the \"calorie\" measured for other temperature intervals.) More recently the calorie has been defined in terms of the joule; the equivalence between the calorie and joule is historically known as the mechanical equivalent of heat. Several definitions of the calorie are now in common use, including (2): thermochemical calorie 1 cal = 4.184 J (exact) 15 °C calorie 1 cal = 4.1858 J International Table calorie 1 cal = 4.1868 J (exact) mean calorie 1 cal = 4.1900 J The International Table (IT) calorie has been adopted in the publications of the Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy', 'the joule (symbol J) is the unit of energy. It is not frequently used outside of the scientific community in the United States, but it is in other countries. In the United States, for example, the energy content of a food product is most frequently stated in food calories. This energy can be represented in joules, as it is in many places of the world. In Australia, a Diet Coca Cola is labelled Low Joule rather than Low Cal, as it is in the United States. Measurement of Energy Scientists have examined energy and power in a variety of ways over the years. As a result, each sort of energy – electrical, mechanical, chemical, thermal, and nuclear – developed its own measurement method, and almost every energy relevant sector evolved its own vocabulary- for example, car salespeople when discussing horsepower. Tons and BTUs are installed by HVAC contractors. Kilowatt-hours are delivered by electric utilities. Newtons and joules are terms used by scientists. The International System of Units (SI) was established from the metric system in 1960 to offer a uniform language for all physical entities. The SI is based on seven base units, from which all other physical values may be calculated. A newton (derived unit of force), for example, is stated as 1 kilogram (base unit of mass) accelerated at one metre (base unit of length) per second (base unit of time) squared. We also have some multiples and fractions of units. A megawatt (MW), for example, is one million (10 6 ) watts; a milliwatt (mW) is one-thousandth (10 -3 ) of a watt. Although the energy industry is beginning to utilise SI language, conventional terminologies continue to predominate. Many automobile manufacturers now indicate engine power in kilowatts, but in parentheses following the horsepower rating: 187 hp (140']...\n"

      "[INFO] Query: what kind of tigers are extinct?...\n",
      "[INFO] Chunks: [\"ate a variety of mammals, including deer, wild pigs , and mountain sheep. Little is known about their behavior in the wild, though human hunters frequently took advantage of their meat-eating habits to trap and kill these incredible creatures. Far more is known about what killed Caspian tigers off. Namely, overhunting by humans, loss of habitat to agricultural needs, and the loss of game animals. How Many Types of Tigers are Left? Less than 3,000 tigers currently live in the wild ©iStock.com/ANDREYGUDKOV Today, science recognizes two official species of the tiger: the continental tiger, and the Sunda island tiger. However, in the past scientists classified as many as nine types of tigers, three of which are now extinct. One more subspecies, the South China tiger , is considered functionally extinct, as no live specimen has been seen in over ten years. Tiger Conservation: What You Can Do Today, fewer than 3,000 tigers live in the wild, occupying under 4% of their historic ranges. All subspecies are either Critically Endangered or functionally extinct. One of the biggest threats to their continued existence is the black market trade in exotic animals and exotic animal parts. Habitat loss and fragmentation are also threats to our few remaining tigers. The first step in protecting tigers is to educate yourself on why these creatures are so important and what can be done to save them.

Tiger Quiz - 6,206 People Couldn't Ace This Quiz Watch The Heart-Stopping Moment When This\", 'Extinct References Overview of Tigers The tiger is considered to be one of the few animal species that has striped fur (aside from zebras). Such color allows them to blend with their environment and easily attack their potential prey. Interestingly enough, these stripes would still be seen on the skin even if the fur is shaved. During hunting, these cats rely mostly on their sense of sight and hearing rather than a sense of smell. Tigers are solitary and prefer to hunt alone. And like most animals, they prefer larger territories to which they mark using their urine, feces, and vocalizations. An average female tiger gives birth to two to four young (called cubs ) every two years. If ever all these cubs die at a single time, the female tiger can produce again after five months. There were originally nine subspecies of the species Pathera tigris , but only six of them are remaining now. See endangered tiger species section below for more details. However, due to various reasons, three of them had already gone extinct, with an average of one per twenty years. Why Are Tigers Endangered? Countless reasons, mostly man-made, are responsible for the continuing decrease in the number of tigers. These reasons include habitat loss, climate change, illegal poaching, and retaliatory killings. They are explained below: 1.

At the start of the 20 th century, there were 100,000 tigers in the wild. Now between 3,000 and 4,000 tigers remain due to hunting and habitat loss.

This is enough time for genetic differences to arise but not enough time for them to look really different from each other. Nine subspecies are genetically justified and recognized. Three subspecies are extinct already and the other six tiger subspecies are classified as endangered by the IUCN.

Bengal tigers are the second largest tiger subspecies and enjoy eating pigs, deer, and other hoofed animals. They live in grasslands, subtropical and tropical rainforests, deciduous forests, and mangroves. Perhaps one reason that they have survived is that they don’t need much space compared to other tigers; about 18 tigers can live in 100 square km (39 square miles). The Golden Tabby Bengal tiger.

Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experiments, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows . They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time. Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals) and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett\\'s leadership, they released two hit singles, \" Arnold Layne \" and \" See Emily Play \", and the successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). The guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind Pink Floyd\\'s most successful albums, The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall , Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards . Pink Floyd also composed several film scores . Following personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1981, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced the albums A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994), backed by major tours, before entering a long hiatus. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a performance at the global awareness event Live\\xa08 . Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was based on unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions. In 2022, Gilmour and Mason reformed Pink Floyd to release the song \" Hey, Hey, Rise Up! \" in protest at the Russian invasion of Ukraine . By 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250\\xa0million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time . The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame , [1] and these albums and Wish You Were Here are among the best-selling albums of all time . Four Pink Floyd albums topped the US Billboard 200 , and five topped the UK Albums Chart . Pink Floyd\\'s hit singles include \"Arnold Layne\" (1967), \"See Emily Play\" (1967), \" Money \" (1973), \" Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2 \" (1979), \" Not Now John \" (1983), \" On the Turning Away \" (1987) and \" High Hopes \" (1994). They were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize in Sweden for their contribution to modern music. History 1963–1965: formation Preceding the band Roger Waters and Nick Mason met while studying architecture at the London Polytechnic at Regent Street . [2] They first played music together in a group formed by fellow students Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe, [3] with Noble\\'s sister Sheilagh. Richard Wright , a fellow architecture student, [nb 1] joined later that year, and the group became a sextet, Sigma\\xa06. Waters played lead guitar, Mason drums, and Wright rhythm guitar, later moving to keyboards. [5] The band performed at private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of the Regent Street Polytechnic. They performed songs by the Searchers and material written by their manager and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman. [6] In September 1963, Waters and Mason moved into a flat at 39 Stanhope Gardens, Highgate in London, owned by Mike Leonard, [7] a part-time tutor at the nearby Hornsey College of Art and the Regent Street Polytechnic. [8] [nb 2] Mason moved out after the 1964 academic year, and guitarist Bob Klose moved in during September 1964, prompting Waters\\'s switch to bass. [9] [nb 3] Sigma\\xa06 went through several names, including the Meggadeaths, the Abdabs and the Screaming Abdabs, Leonard\\'s Lodgers, and the Spectrum Five, before settling on the Tea Set. [10] [nb 4] In 1964, as Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own band, guitarist Syd Barrett joined Klose and Waters at Stanhope Gardens. [14] Barrett, two years younger, had moved to London in 1962 to study at the Camberwell College of Arts . [15] Waters and Barrett were childhood friends; Waters had often visited Barrett and watched him play guitar at Barrett\\'s mother\\'s house. [16] Mason said about Barrett: \"In a period when everyone was being cool in a very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd was unfashionably outgoing; my enduring memory of our first encounter is the fact that he bothered to come up and introduce himself to me.\" [17] Noble and Metcalfe left the Tea Set in late 1963, and Klose introduced the band to singer Chris Dennis, a technician with the Royal Air Force (RAF). [18] In December 1964, they secured their first recording time, at a studio in West Hampstead, through one of Wright\\'s friends, who let them use some down time free. Wright, who was taking a break from his studies, did not participate in the session. [19] [nb 5] When the RAF assigned Dennis a post in Bahrain in early 1965, Barrett became the band\\'s frontman. [20] [nb 6] Later that year, they became the resident band at the Countdown Club near Kensington High Street in London, where from late night until early morning they played three sets of 90 minutes each. During this period, spurred by the group\\'s need to extend their sets to minimise song repetition, the band realised that \"songs could be extended with lengthy solos\", wrote Mason. [21] After pressure from his parents and advice from his college tutors, Klose quit the band in mid-1965 and Barrett took over lead guitar. [22] 1965–1967: early years Pink Floyd The group rebranded as the Pink Floyd Sound in late 1965. Barrett created the name on the spur of the moment when he discovered that another band, also called the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs. [23] The name is derived from the given names of two blues musicians whose Piedmont blues records Barrett had in his collection, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council . [24] By 1966, the group\\'s repertoire consisted mainly of rhythm and blues songs, and they had begun to receive paid bookings, including a performance at the Marquee Club in December 1966, where Peter Jenner , a lecturer at the London School of Economics , noticed them. Jenner was impressed by the sonic effects Barrett and Wright created and, with his business partner and friend Andrew King , became their manager. [25] The pair had little experience in the music industry and used King\\'s inheritance to set up Blackhill Enterprises , purchasing about £1,000 (equivalent to £19,800 in 2021 [26] ) worth of new instruments and equipment for the band. [nb 7] Around this time, Jenner suggested the band drop the \"Sound\" from their name. [28] Under Jenner and King\\'s guidance, Pink Floyd became part of London\\'s underground music scene, playing at venues including All Saints Hall and the Marquee. [29] While performing at the Countdown Club, the band had experimented with long instrumental excursions, and they began to expand them with rudimentary but effective light shows, projected by coloured slides and domestic lights. [30] Jenner and King\\'s social connections helped gain the band prominent coverage in the Financial Times and an article in the Sunday Times which stated: \"At the launching of the new magazine IT the other night a pop group called the Pink Floyd played throbbing music while a series of bizarre coloured shapes flashed on a huge screen behind them\\xa0... apparently very psychedelic.\" [31] In 1966, the band strengthened their business relationship with Blackhill Enterprises, becoming equal partners with Jenner and King and the band members each holding a one-sixth share. [28] By late 1966, their set included fewer R&B standards and more Barrett originals, many of which would be included on their first album. [32] While they had significantly increased the frequency of their performances, the band were still not widely accepted. Following a performance at a Catholic youth club, the owner refused to pay them, claiming that their performance was not music. [33] When their management filed suit in a small claims court against the owner of the youth organisation, a local magistrate upheld the owner\\'s decision. The band was much better received at the UFO Club in London, where they began to build a fan base. [34] Barrett\\'s performances were enthusiastic, \"leaping around\\xa0... madness\\xa0... improvisation\\xa0... [inspired] to get past his limitations and into areas that were\\xa0... very interesting. Which none of the others could do\", wrote biographer Nicholas Schaffner . [35] Signing with EMI In 1967, Pink Floyd began to attract the attention of the music industry. [36] [nb 8] While in negotiations with record companies, IT co-founder and UFO club manager Joe Boyd and Pink Floyd\\'s booking agent, Bryan Morrison , arranged and funded a recording session at Sound Techniques in Kensington . [38] On 15 February 1967, Pink Floyd signed with EMI, receiving a £5,000 advance (equivalent to £96,500 in 2021 [26] ). EMI released the band\\'s first single, \" Arnold Layne \", with the B-side \" Candy and a Currant Bun \", on 10 March 1967 on its Columbia label. [39] [nb 9] Both tracks were recorded on 29 January 1967. [40] [nb 10] \"Arnold Layne\"\\'s references to cross-dressing led to a ban by several radio stations; however, creative manipulation by the retailers who supplied sales figures to the music business meant that the single reached number 20 in the UK. [42] EMI-Columbia released Pink Floyd\\'s second single, \" See Emily Play \", on 16 June 1967. It fared slightly better than \"Arnold Layne\", peaking at number\\xa06 in the UK. [43] The band performed on the BBC\\'s Look of the Week , where Waters and Barrett, erudite and engaging, faced tough questioning from Hans Keller . [44] They appeared on the BBC\\'s Top of the Pops , a popular programme that controversially required artists to mime their singing and playing. [45] Though Pink Floyd returned for two more performances, by the third, Barrett had begun to unravel, and around this time the band first noticed significant changes in his behaviour. [46] By early 1967, he was regularly using LSD , and Mason described him as \"completely distanced from everything going on\". [47] The Piper at the Gates of Dawn Main article: The Piper at the Gates of Dawn Morrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd\\'s first recording contract. As part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. [48] [nb 11] Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. [50] EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album reached number six, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. [51] One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. [52] Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett\\'s mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child , who commented: \"I found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so\\xa0... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [and] we got him out to the stage\\xa0... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down\". [53] Forced to cancel Pink Floyd\\'s appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival , as well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. [54] Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing , and though Waters personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused to come out of the car. [55] A stay in Formentera with Sam Hutt , a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their first tour of the US in October. [56] [nb 12] As the US tour went on, Barrett\\'s condition grew steadily worse. [58] During appearances on the Dick Clark and Pat Boone shows in November, Barrett confounded his hosts by giving terse answers to questions (or not responding at all) and staring into space. He refused to move his lips when it came time to mime \"See Emily Play\" on Boone\\'s show. After these embarrassing episodes, King ended their US visit and immediately sent them home to London. [59] [nb 13] Soon after their return, they supported Jimi Hendrix during a tour of England; however, Barrett\\'s depression worsened as the tour continued. [61] [nb 14] 1967–1978: transition and international success 1967: replacement of Barrett by Gilmour In December 1967, reaching a crisis point with Barrett, Pink Floyd added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member. [64] [65] [nb 15] Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied with him at Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s. [16] The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France. [67] In 1965, while a member of Joker\\'s Wild , Gilmour had watched the Tea Set. [68] Morrison\\'s assistant, Steve O\\'Rourke , set Gilmour up in a room at O\\'Rourke\\'s house with a salary of £30 per week (equivalent to £600 in 2021 [26] ). In January 1968, Blackhill Enterprises announced Gilmour as the band\\'s newest member, intending to continue with Barrett as a nonperforming songwriter. [69] According to Jenner, the group planned that Gilmour would\\xa0\"cover for [Barrett\\'s] eccentricities\". When this proved unworkable, it was decided that Barrett would just write material. [70] [nb 16] In an expression of his frustration, Barrett, who was expected to write additional hit singles to follow up \"Arnold Layne\" and \"See Emily Play\", instead introduced \" Have You Got It Yet? \" to the band, intentionally changing the structure on each performance so as to make the song impossible to follow and learn. [64] In a January 1968 photoshoot of Pink Floyd, the photographs show Barrett looking detached from the others, staring into the distance. [72] Working with Barrett eventually proved too difficult, and matters came to a conclusion in January while en route to a performance in Southampton when a band member asked if they should collect Barrett. According to Gilmour, the answer was \"Nah, let\\'s not bother\", signalling the end of Barrett\\'s tenure with Pink Floyd. [73] [nb 17] Waters later said, \"He was our friend, but most of the time we now wanted to strangle him.\" [75] In early March 1968, Pink Floyd met with business partners Jenner and King to discuss the band\\'s future; Barrett agreed to leave. [76] Jenner and King believed Barrett was the creative genius of the band, and decided to represent him and end their relationship with Pink Floyd. [77] Morrison sold his business to NEMS Enterprises , and O\\'Rourke became the band\\'s personal manager. [78] Blackhill announced Barrett\\'s departure on 6 April 1968. [79] [nb 18] After Barrett\\'s departure, the burden of lyrical composition and creative direction fell mostly on Waters. [81] Initially, Gilmour mimed to Barrett\\'s voice on the group\\'s European TV appearances; however, while playing on the university circuit, they avoided Barrett songs in favour of Waters and Wright material such as \" It Would Be So Nice \" and \" Careful with That Axe, Eugene \". [82] Mason said later that Gilmour added greater structure to Pink Floyd\\'s music and that \"we became far less difficult to enjoy, I think\". [83] A Saucerful of Secrets (1968) Main article: A Saucerful of Secrets The psychedelic artwork for A Saucerful of Secrets was the first of many Pink Floyd covers designed by Hipgnosis. In 1968, Pink Floyd returned to Abbey Road Studios to complete their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets , which they had begun in 1967 under Barrett\\'s leadership. The album included Barrett\\'s final contribution to their discography, \" Jugband Blues \". Waters developed his own songwriting, contributing \" Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun \", \" Let There Be More Light \", and \" Corporal Clegg \". Wright composed \" See-Saw \" and \" Remember a Day \". Norman Smith encouraged them to self-produce their music, and they recorded demos of new material at their houses. With Smith\\'s instruction at Abbey Road, they learned how to use the recording studio to realise their artistic vision. However, Smith remained unconvinced by their music, and when Mason struggled to perform his drum part on \"Remember a Day\", Smith stepped in as his replacement. [84] Wright recalled Smith\\'s attitude about the sessions, \"Norman gave up on the second album\\xa0... he was forever saying things like, \\'You can\\'t do twenty minutes of this ridiculous noise \\' \". [85] As neither Waters nor Mason could read music, to illustrate the structure of \" A Saucerful of Secrets \", they invented their own system of notation. Gilmour later described their method as looking \"like an architectural diagram\". [86] Released in June 1968, A Saucerful of Secrets featured a psychedelic cover designed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis . The first of several Pink Floyd album covers designed by Hipgnosis, it was the second time that EMI permitted one of their groups to contract designers for an album jacket. [87] The release reached number nine, spending 11 weeks on the UK chart. [51] Record Mirror gave the album an overall favourable review, but urged listeners to \"forget it as background music to a party\". [86] John Peel described a live performance of the title track as \"like a religious experience\", while NME described the song as \"long and boring\\xa0... [with] little to warrant its monotonous direction\". [85] [nb 19] On the day after the album\\'s UK release, Pink Floyd performed at the first ever free concert in Hyde Park . [89] In July 1968, they made a second visit to the US. Accompanied by the Soft Machine and the Who , it marked Pink Floyd\\'s first major tour. [90] That December, they released \" Point Me at the Sky \"; no more successful than the two singles they had released since \"See Emily Play\", it was their last single until \" Money \" in 1973. [91] Ummagumma (1969), Atom Heart Mother (1970) and Meddle (1971) Main articles: Ummagumma , Atom Heart Mother , and Meddle Waters performing with Pink Floyd at Leeds University in 1970 Ummagumma represented a departure from Pink Floyd\\'s previous work. Released as a double LP on EMI\\'s Harvest label, the first two sides contained live performances recorded at Manchester College of Commerce and Mothers , a club in Birmingham . The second LP contained a single experimental contribution from each band member. [92] Ummagumma was released in November 1969 and received positive reviews. [93] It reached number five, spending 21 weeks on the UK chart. [51] In October 1970, Pink Floyd released Atom Heart Mother . [94] [nb 20] An early version premièred in England in mid January, but disagreements over the mix prompted the hiring of Ron Geesin to work out the sound problems. Geesin worked to improve the score, but with little creative input from the band, production was troublesome. Geesin eventually completed the project with the aid of John Alldis , who was the director of the choir hired to perform on the record. Smith earned an executive producer credit, and the album marked his final official contribution to the band\\'s discography. Gilmour said it was \"A neat way of saying that he didn\\'t\\xa0... do anything\". [96] Waters was critical of Atom Heart Mother , claiming that he would prefer if it were \"thrown into the dustbin and never listened to by anyone ever again\". [97] Gilmour once described it as \"a load of rubbish\", stating: \"I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period.\" [97] Pink Floyd\\'s first number-one album, Atom Heart Mother was hugely successful in Britain, spending 18 weeks on the UK chart. [51] It premièred at the Bath Festival on 27 June 1970. [98] Pink Floyd toured extensively across America and Europe in 1970. [99] [nb 21] In 1971, Pink Floyd took second place in a reader\\'s poll, in Melody Maker , and for the first time were making a profit. Mason and Wright became fathers and bought homes in London while Gilmour, still single, moved to a 19th-century farm in Essex. Waters installed a home recording studio at his house in Islington in a converted tool shed at the back of his garden. [100] In January 1971, upon their return from touring Atom Heart Mother , Pink Floyd began working on new material. [101] Lacking a central theme, they attempted several unproductive experiments; engineer John Leckie described the sessions as often beginning in the afternoon and ending early the next morning, \"during which time nothing would get [accomplished]. There was no record company contact whatsoever, except when their label manager would show up now and again with a couple of bottles of wine and a couple of joints\". [102] The band spent long periods working on basic sounds, or a guitar riff. They also spent several days at Air Studios, attempting to create music using a variety of household objects, a project which would be revisited between The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here . [103] Pink Floyd in 1971, following Barrett\\'s departure. From left to right: Waters, Mason, Gilmour, Wright. Meddle was released in October 1971, and reached number three, spending 82 weeks on the UK chart. [51] It marks a transition between the Barrett-led group of the late 1960s and the emerging Pink Floyd; [104] Jean-Charles Costa of Rolling Stone wrote that \"not only confirms lead guitarist David Gilmour\\'s emergence as a real shaping force with the group, it states forcefully and accurately that the group is well into the growth track again\". [105] [nb 22] [nb 23] NME called it \"an exceptionally good album\", singling out \" Echoes \" as the \"Zenith which the Floyd have been striving for\". [109] However, Melody Maker\\'s Michael Watts found it underwhelming, calling the album \"a soundtrack to a non-existent movie\", and shrugging off Pink Floyd as \"so much sound and fury, signifying nothing\". [110] Obscured by Clouds (1972) Main article: Obscured by Clouds Pink Floyd had already recorded the soundtracks to the films The Committee (1968) and More (1969) [111] and part of Zabriskie Point (1970). On the back of More \\' s success, the director Barbet Schroeder asked them to record the soundtrack of his next major project, La Vallée . [112] The band took two breaks to Strawberry Studios , Château d\\'Hérouville , France, either side of a Japanese tour, to write and record music for the film. [113] The album was mixed from 4–6 April at Morgan Studios in London. [113] During the first recording session in February 1972, the French television station ORTF filmed a short segment of the band recording the album, including interviews with Waters and Gilmour. [113] Waters said that early UK pressings of the album contained \"excessive sibilance\". After recording had finished, the band fell out with the film company, prompting them to release the soundtrack album as Obscured by Clouds , rather than La Vallée . The film was retitled La Vallée (Obscured by Clouds) on its release. [112] The songs on Obscured by Clouds were all short and economical, with a strong country music influence. The album also featured the EMS VCS 3 synthesiser, which Wright had purchased from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop . \" Burning Bridges \" was one of two songwriting collaborations between Wright and Waters. \" Childhood\\'s End \" was the last song Pink Floyd released to have lyrics written by Gilmour until the release of A Momentary Lapse of Reason in 1987. \" Free Four \" was the first Pink Floyd song since \"See Emily Play\" to attract significant airplay in the US, and the second to refer to the death of Waters\\' father during World War II. \"Stay\" was written and sung by Wright, with lyrics by Waters. The closing instrumental on the album ends with a recording of the Mapuga tribe chanting, as seen in the film. The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) Main article: The Dark Side of the Moon Pink Floyd recorded The Dark Side of the Moon between May 1972 and January 1973 with EMI staff engineer Alan Parsons at Abbey Road. The title is an allusion to lunacy rather than astronomy. [114] The band had composed and refined the material while touring the UK, Japan, North America, and Europe. [115] Producer Chris Thomas assisted Parsons. [116] Hipgnosis designed the packaging, which included George Hardie \\'s iconic refracting prism design on the cover. [117] Thorgerson\\'s cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity. [118] Waters is the sole author of the lyrics. [119] Pink Floyd performing on their early 1973 US tour, shortly before the release of The Dark Side of the Moon Released in March 1973, the LP became an instant chart success in the UK and throughout Western Europe, earning an enthusiastic response from critics. [120] Each member of Pink Floyd except Wright boycotted the press release of The Dark Side of the Moon because a quadraphonic mix had not yet been completed, and they felt presenting the album through a poor-quality stereo PA system was insufficient. [121] Melody Maker \\'s Roy Hollingworth described side one as \"utterly confused\\xa0... [and] difficult to follow\", but praised side two, writing: \"The songs, the sounds\\xa0... [and] the rhythms were solid\\xa0... [the] saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled\". [122] Rolling Stone \\'s Loyd Grossman described it as \"a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement.\" [123] Throughout March 1973, The Dark Side of the Moon featured as part of Pink Floyd\\'s US tour. [124] The album is one of the most commercially successful rock albums of all time. A US number-one, it remained on the Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart for more than fourteen years during the 1970s and 1980s, selling more than 45\\xa0million copies worldwide. [125] In Britain, it reached number two, spending 364 weeks on the UK chart. [51] The Dark Side of the Moon is the world\\'s third best-selling album, and the twenty-first best-selling album of all time in the US. [126] The success of the album brought enormous wealth to the members of Pink Floyd. Waters and Wright bought large country houses while Mason became a collector of expensive cars. [127] Disenchanted with their US record company, Capitol Records , Pink Floyd and O\\'Rourke negotiated a new contract with Columbia Records , who gave them a reported advance of $1,000,000 (US$5,933,873 in 2022 dollars). [128] In Europe, they continued to be represented by Harvest Records. [129] Wish You Were Here (1975) Main article: Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album) The Black Strat , a black Fender Stratocaster bought by Gilmour in 1970 and used on songs including \" Shine On You Crazy Diamond \", \" Money \" and \" Comfortably Numb \" After a tour of the UK performing Dark Side , Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here . [130] Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project , and so the band turned to Brian Humphries. [131] Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early sessions as \"falling within a difficult period\" and Waters found them \"tortuous\". [132] Gilmour was more interested in improving the band\\'s existing material. Mason\\'s failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming. [132] Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. [132] During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. [133] These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. [134] The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate. [135] Waters commented: \"Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt\\xa0... [that] indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd.\" [136] While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio. Thorgerson recalled that he \"sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn\\'t really there\". [137] He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him. Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience. [138] [nb 24] Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth . Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US. [140] Animals (1977) Main article: Animals (Pink Floyd album) Battersea Power Station is featured in the cover image for Animals . In 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began converting them into a recording studio and storage space. [141] In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals , in their newly finished 24-track studio. [142] The album concept originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell \\'s political fable Animal Farm . The lyrics describe different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. [143] [nb 25] Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station , over which they superimposed an image of a pig. [145] [nb 26] The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for \" Dogs \", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part \" Pigs on the Wing \". [148] Wright commented: \"It was partly my fault because I didn\\'t push my material\\xa0... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there.\" [149] Mason recalled: \"Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately.\" [149] [nb 27] Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals ; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering. [151] Animals was the first Pink Floyd album with no writing credit for Wright, who said: \"This was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band\\xa0... that it was only because of him that [we] were still going\\xa0... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me.\" [151] Released in January 1977, Animals reached number two in the UK and number three in the US. [152] NME described it as \"one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music\", and Melody Maker \\'s Karl Dallas called it \"[an] uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific\". [153] Pink Floyd performed much of Animals during their \" In the Flesh \" tour. It was their first experience playing large stadiums, whose size caused unease in the band. [154] Waters began arriving at each venue alone, departing immediately after the performance. On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to quit. [155] At the Montreal Olympic Stadium , a group of noisy and enthusiastic fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters so much that he spat at one of them. [156] [nb 28] The end of the tour marked a low point for Gilmour, who felt that the band achieved the success they had sought, with nothing left for them to accomplish. [157] 1978–1985: Waters-led era The Wall (1979) Main articles: The Wall and Pink Floyd – The Wall In July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented two ideas for Pink Floyd\\'s next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall; the other later became Waters\\'s first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking . Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former. [158] [nb 29] Bob Ezrin co-produced and wrote a forty-page script for the new album. [160] Ezrin based the story on the central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters\\'s childhood experiences, the most notable of which was the death of his father in World War II . This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person. [161] [nb 30] During the recording of The Wall , the band became dissatisfied with Wright\\'s lack of contribution and fired him. [164] Gilmour said that Wright was dismissed as he \"hadn\\'t contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album—he did very, very little\". [165] According to Mason, Wright would sit in on the sessions \"without doing anything, just \\'being a producer \\' \". [166] Waters said the band agreed that Wright would either have to \"have a long battle\" or agree to \"leave quietly\" after the album was finished; Wright accepted the ultimatum and left. [167] [nb 31] The Wall was supported by Pink Floyd\\'s first single since \"Money\", \" Another Brick in the Wall (Part II) \", which topped the charts in the US and the UK. [170] The Wall was released on 30 November 1979 and topped the Billboard chart in the US for 15 weeks, reaching number three in the UK. [171] It is tied for sixth most certified album by RIAA , with 23\\xa0million certified units sold in the US. [172] The cover, with a stark brick wall and band name, was the first Pink Floyd album cover since The Piper at the Gates of Dawn not designed by Hipgnosis. [173] Gerald Scarfe produced a series of animations for the Wall tour. He also commissioned the construction of large inflatable puppets representing characters from the storyline, including the \"Mother\", the \"Ex-wife\" and the \"Schoolmaster\". Pink Floyd used the puppets during their performances. [174] Relationships within the band reached an all-time low; their four Winnebagos parked in a circle, the doors facing away from the centre. Waters used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue and stayed in different hotels from the rest of the band. Wright returned as a paid musician, making him the only band member to profit from the tour, which lost about $600,000 (US$1,931,332 in 2022 dollars [128] ). [175] The Wall was adapted into a film, Pink Floyd – The Wall. The film was conceived as a combination of live concert footage and animated scenes; however, the concert footage proved impractical to film. Alan Parker agreed to direct and took a different approach. The animated sequences remained, but scenes were acted by actors with no dialogue. Waters was screentested but quickly discarded, and they asked Bob Geldof to accept the role of Pink. Geldof was initially dismissive, condemning The Wall \\'s storyline as \"bollocks\". [176] Eventually won over by the prospect of participation in a significant film and receiving a large payment for his work, Geldof agreed. [177] [nb 32] Screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1982, Pink Floyd – The Wall premièred in the UK in July 1982. [178] [nb 33] The Final Cut (1983) Main article: The Final Cut (album) In 1982, Waters suggested a project with the working title Spare Bricks , originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War , Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher \\'s response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall . Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band\\'s lyrical repertoire. [179] Michael Kamen , a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall , mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. [180] [nb 34] The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour\\'s name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions. [182] [nb 35] Though Mason\\'s musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. [183] [nb 36] Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. [184] Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. [185] Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. [186] Gilmour later commented: \"I\\'m certainly guilty at times of being lazy\\xa0... but he wasn\\'t right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut .\" [186] [nb 37] Rolling Stone gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \"a superlative achievement\\xa0... art rock\\'s crowning masterpiece\". [188] [nb 38] Loder viewed The Final Cut as \"essentially a Roger Waters solo album\". [190] Waters\\'s departure and legal battles Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face , in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984). [191] Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity , which went almost unnoticed upon its release. [192] [nb 39] Mason released his second solo album, Profiles , in August 1985. [193] Gilmour, Mason, Waters and O\\'Rourke met for dinner in 1984 to discuss their future. Mason and Gilmour left the restaurant thinking that Pink Floyd could continue after Waters had finished The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking , noting that they had had several hiatuses before; however, Waters left believing that Mason and Gilmour had accepted that Pink Floyd were finished. Mason said that Waters later saw the meeting as \"duplicity rather than diplomacy\", and wrote in his memoir: \"Clearly, our communication skills were still troublingly nonexistent. We left the restaurant with diametrically opposed views of what had been decided.\" [194] Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking , Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O\\'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O\\'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band\\'s manager. He terminated his management contract with O\\'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. [193] [nb 40] Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \"a spent force creatively\". [196] When Waters\\'s lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band\\'s name. Gilmour responded with a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. [197] The sides reached an out-of-court agreement, finalised on Gilmour\\'s houseboat, the Astoria , on Christmas Eve 1987. [198] In 2013, Waters said he regretted the lawsuit and had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the band members. [199] 1985–present: Gilmour-led era A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) Main article: A Momentary Lapse of Reason The Astoria recording studio In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for a new project. [200] Initially, there was no commitment to a Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album. However, by the end of 1986, Gilmour had decided to make the material into a Pink Floyd project, the first without Waters. [201] [202] [nb 41] There were legal obstacles to Wright\\'s re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions. [203] Gilmour later stated that Wright\\'s presence \"would make us stronger legally and musically\", and Pink Floyd employed him with weekly earnings of $11,000. [204] Recording sessions began on Gilmour\\'s houseboat, the Astoria , moored along the River Thames . [205] [nb 42] Gilmour felt that lyrics had become more important than the music under Waters, and sought to restore the balance. [207] The group found it difficult to work without Waters\\'s creative direction; [208] to write lyrics, Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough , eventually choosing Anthony Moore . [209] Wright and Mason were out of practice; Gilmour said they had been \"destroyed\" by Waters, and their contributions were minimal. [210] Pink Floyd in 1989 on the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987. Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut , designed the album cover. [211] To emphasise that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover — the first since Meddle — featuring only Gilmour and Mason. [212] [nb 43] The album reached number three in the UK and the US. [214] Waters said: \"I think it\\'s facile, but a quite clever forgery\\xa0... The songs are poor in general\\xa0... [and] Gilmour\\'s lyrics are third-rate.\" [215] Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band\\'s top form, Wright disagreed, stating: \"Roger\\'s criticisms are fair. It\\'s not a band album at all.\" [216] Q described it as essentially a Gilmour solo album. [217] Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. [218] Early rehearsals for the tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright out of practice. Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured North America, Waters\\'s K.A.O.S. On the Road tour was on occasion, close by, in much smaller venues. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for Pink Floyd\\'s use of the flying pig . Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters\\'s design. [219] The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained the right to use the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall . [220] The Division Bell (1994) Main article: The Division Bell The album artwork for The Division Bell , designed by Storm Thorgerson, was intended to represent the absence of Barrett and Waters from the band. For several years, Pink Floyd had busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the La Carrera Panamericana and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event. [221] [nb 44] In January 1993, they began working on a new album, The Division Bell , in Britannia Row Studios, where Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, improvising material. After about two weeks, they had enough ideas to begin creating songs. Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria , where the band worked from February to May 1993. [223] Contractually, Wright was not a member of the band, and said \"It came close to a point where I wasn\\'t going to do the album\". [224] However, he earned five co-writing credits, his first on a Pink Floyd album since 1975\\'s Wish You Were Here . [224] Gilmour\\'s future wife, the novelist Polly Samson , is also credited; she helped Gilmour write tracks including \" High Hopes \", a collaborative arrangement which, though initially tense, \"pulled the whole album together\", according to Ezrin. [225] They hired Michael Kamen to arrange the orchestral parts; Dick Parry and Chris Thomas also returned. [226] The writer Douglas Adams provided the album title and Thorgerson the cover artwork. [227] [nb 45] Thorgerson drew inspiration from the Moai monoliths of Easter Island ; two opposing faces forming an implied third face about which he commented: \"the absent face—the ghost of Pink Floyd\\'s past, Syd and Roger\". [229] To avoid competing against other album releases, as had happened with A Momentary Lapse , Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would resume touring. [230] The Division Bell reached number 1 in the UK and the US, [126] and spent 51 weeks on the UK chart. [51] Pink Floyd spent more than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California , before opening The Division Bell tour on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost identical road crew to that used for their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour. [231] They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety. [232] [nb 46] The tour, Pink Floyd\\'s last, ended on 29 October 1994. [233] [nb 47] Mason published a memoir, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd , in 2004. [235] 2005–2006: Live\\xa08 reunion Waters (right) rejoined his former bandmates at Live\\xa08 in Hyde Park , London on 2 July 2005. On 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd at Live\\xa08 , a benefit concert raising awareness about poverty, in Hyde Park , London. [236] It was their first performance together in more than 24\\xa0years. [236] The reunion was arranged by the Live\\xa08 organiser, Bob Geldof . After Gilmour declined, Geldof asked Mason, who contacted Waters. About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day Gilmour agreed. In a statement to the press, the band stressed the unimportance of their problems in the context of the Live\\xa08 event. [121] The group planned their setlist at the Connaught hotel in London, followed by three days of rehearsals at Black Island Studios. [121] The sessions were problematic, with disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order was decided on the eve of the event. [237] At the beginning of their performance of \"Wish You Were Here\", Waters told the audience: \"[It is] quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you\\xa0... We\\'re doing this for everyone who\\'s not here, and particularly of course for Syd.\" [238] At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, and the band embraced. Images of the embrace were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live\\xa08. [239] [nb 48] Waters said: \"I don\\'t think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit\\xa0... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity.\" [241] Though Pink Floyd turned down a contract worth £136\\xa0million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting it ought to be for a charity event only. [239] However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen: \"The [Live\\xa08] rehearsals convinced me it wasn\\'t something I wanted to be doing a lot of\\xa0... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people\\'s lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won\\'t be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn\\'t to do with animosity or anything like that. It\\'s just\\xa0... I\\'ve been there, I\\'ve done it.\" [242] In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed for the Italian newspaper La Repubblica , which announced that Pink Floyd had disbanded. [243] Gilmour said that Pink Floyd were \"over\", citing his advancing age and his preference for working alone. [243] He and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite. [244] [245] [nb 49] 2006–2008: deaths of Barrett and Wright Barrett died on 7 July 2006, at his home in Cambridge, aged\\xa060. [247] His funeral was held at Cambridge Crematorium on 18 July 2006. No Pink Floyd members attended. Wright said: \"The band are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett\\'s death. Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire.\" [247] Although Barrett had faded into obscurity over the decades, the national press praised him for his contributions to music. [248] [nb 50] On 10 May 2007, Waters, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason performed at the Barrett tribute concert \"Madcap\\'s Last Laugh\" at the Barbican Centre in London. Gilmour, Wright, and Mason performed the Barrett compositions \" Bike \" and \"Arnold Layne\", and Waters performed a solo version of his song \"Flickering Flame\". [250] Wright died of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged\\xa065. [251] His former bandmates paid tributes to his life and work; Gilmour said that Wright\\'s contributions were often overlooked, and that his \"soulful voice and playing were vital, magical components of our most recognised Pink Floyd sound\". [252] A week after Wright\\'s death, Gilmour performed \"Remember a Day\" from A Saucerful of Secrets , written and originally sung by Wright, in tribute on BBC Two\\'s Later... with Jools Holland . [253] The keyboardist Keith Emerson released a statement praising Wright as the \"backbone\" of Pink Floyd. [254] 2010–2011: further performances and rereleases In March 2010, Pink Floyd went to the High Court of Justice to prevent EMI selling individual tracks online, arguing that their 1999 contract \"prohibits the sale of albums in any configuration other than the original\". The judge ruled in their favour, which the Guardian described as a \"triumph for artistic integrity\" and a \"vindication of the album as a creative format\". [255] In January 2011, Pink Floyd signed a new five-year contract with EMI that permitted the sale of single downloads. [256] On 10 July 2010, Waters and Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation. The event, which raised money for Palestinian children, took place at Kiddington Hall in Oxfordshire, England, with an audience of approximately 200. [257] In return for Waters\\'s appearance at the event, Gilmour performed \"Comfortably Numb\" at Waters\\'s performance of The Wall at the London O2 Arena on 12 May 2011, singing the choruses and playing the guitar solos. Mason also joined, playing tambourine for \" Outside the Wall \" with Gilmour on mandolin. [258] On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd...? , reissuing the back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including \"Experience\" and \"Immersion\" multi-disc multi-format editions. The albums were remastered by James Guthrie , co-producer of The Wall . [259] In November 2015, Pink Floyd released a limited edition EP, 1965: Their First Recordings , comprising six songs recorded prior to The Piper at the Gates of Dawn . [260] The Endless River (2014) and Nick Mason\\'s Saucerful of Secrets In November 2013, Gilmour and Mason revisited recordings made with Wright during the Division Bell sessions to create a new Pink Floyd album. They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and \"generally harness studio technology\". [261] Waters was not involved. [262] Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: \"I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound. Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was.\" [263] The Endless River was released in the following year. Though it received mixed reviews, [264] it became the most pre-ordered album of all time on Amazon UK [265] and debuted at number one in several countries. [266] [267] The vinyl edition was the fastest-selling UK vinyl release of 2014 and the fastest-selling since 1997. [268] Gilmour said The Endless River would be Pink Floyd\\'s last album, saying: \"I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is\\xa0... It\\'s a shame, but this is the end.\" [269] There was no supporting tour, as Gilmour felt it was impossible without Wright. [270] [271] In 2015, Gilmour reiterated that Pink Floyd were \"done\" and that to reunite without Wright would be wrong. [272] In November 2016, Pink Floyd released a box set, The Early Years 1965–1972 , comprising outtakes, live recordings, remixes, and films from their early career. [273] It was followed in December 2019 by The Later Years , compiling Pink Floyd\\'s work after Waters\\'s departure. The set includes a remixed version of A Momentary Lapse of Reason with more contributions by Wright and Mason, and an expanded reissue of the live album Delicate Sound of Thunder . [274] In November 2020, the reissue of Delicate Sound of Thunder was given a standalone release on multiple formats. [275] Pink Floyd\\'s Live at Knebworth 1990 performance, previously released as part of the Later Years box set, was released on CD and vinyl on 30 April. [276] In 2018, Mason formed a new band, Nick Mason\\'s Saucerful of Secrets , to perform Pink Floyd\\'s early material. The band includes Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet and the longtime Pink Floyd collaborator Guy Pratt . [277] They toured Europe in September 2018 [278] and North America in 2019. [279] Waters joined the band at the New York Beacon Theatre to perform vocals for \" Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun \". [280] 2022–present: \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\" and conflicts Main article: Hey, Hey, Rise Up! Mason said in 2018 that, while he remained close to Gilmour and Waters, the two remained \"at loggerheads\". [281] A remixed version of Animals was delayed until 2022 after Gilmour and Waters could not agree on the liner notes. [282] In a public statement, Waters accused Gilmour of attempting to steal credit and complained that Gilmour would not allow him to use Pink Floyd\\'s website and social media channels. [282] Rolling Stone noted that the pair seemed \"to have hit yet another low point in their relationship\". [282] Andriy Khlyvnyuk , whose vocals are featured in \" Hey, Hey, Rise Up! \" In March 2022, Gilmour and Mason reunited as Pink Floyd, alongside Pratt and the keyboardist Nitin Sawhney , to record the single \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\", protesting Russian\\'s invasion of Ukraine that February. It features vocals by the BoomBox singer Andriy Khlyvnyuk , taken from an Instagram video of Khlyvnyuk singing the 1914 Ukrainian anthem \" Oh, the Red Viburnum in the Meadow \" in Kyiv . Gilmour described Khlyvnyuk\\'s performance as \"a powerful moment that made me want to put it to music\". [283] \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\" was released on 8 April, with proceeds going to Ukrainian Humanitarian Relief. Gilmour said the war had inspired him to release new music as Pink Floyd as he felt it was important to raise awareness in support of Ukraine. [283] Asked whether he was considering more Pink Floyd music, Gilmour said the single was a \"one-off\". [284] Pink Floyd removed music from streaming services in Russia and Belarus. Their work with Waters remained, leading to speculation that Waters had blocked its removal; Gilmour said only that \"I was disappointed\\xa0... Read into that what you will.\" [283] Waters refused to condemn Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine and criticised \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\". [285] Shortly afterwards, Gilmour and his wife, Polly Samson , condemned Waters on Twitter as \"a lying, thieving, hypocritical, tax-avoiding, lip-synching, misogynistic, sick-with-envy megalomaniac\". [285] In March 2023, Variety reported that Pink Floyd had been seeking to sell their back catalogue for some time, but that it had been hampered by infighting. [286] Band members Main article: List of Pink Floyd band members Syd Barrett – lead and rhythm guitars, vocals (1965–1968) (died 2006 [287] ) David Gilmour – lead and rhythm guitars, vocals, bass, keyboards, synthesisers (1967–present) Roger Waters – bass, vocals, rhythm guitar, synthesisers (1965–1985, 2005 (guest) ) Richard Wright – keyboards, piano, organ, synthesisers, vocals (1965–79, 1980–81 (session) , 1986–87 (session) , 1988–2008 [nb 51] ) (died 2008 [290] ) Nick Mason – drums, percussion (1965–present) Musicianship Genres Considered one of the UK\\'s first psychedelic music groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London\\'s underground music scene, [291] [nb 52] appearing at UFO Club and its successor Middle Earth . According to Rolling Stone : \"By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched on hard rock , blues, country , folk , and electronic music .\" [294] Released in 1968, the song \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\" helped galvanise their reputation as an art rock group. [82] Other genres attributed to the band are space rock , [295] experimental rock , [296] acid rock , [297] [298] [299] proto-prog , [300] experimental pop (while under Barrett), [301] psychedelic pop , [302] and psychedelic rock . [303] O\\'Neill Surber comments on the music of Pink Floyd: Rarely will you find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or predictable three-chord blues progressions; and never will you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype. Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging\\xa0... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to have a life of its own\\xa0... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance. [304] During the late 1960s, the press labelled Pink Floyd\\'s music psychedelic pop, [305] progressive pop [306] and progressive rock ; [307] they gained a following as a psychedelic pop group. [305] [308] [ page\\xa0needed ] [309] In 1968, Wright said: \"It\\'s hard to see why we were cast as the first British psychedelic group. We never saw ourselves that way\\xa0... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun\\xa0... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted\\xa0... the emphasis\\xa0... [is] firmly on spontaneity and improvisation.\" [310] Waters said later: \"There wasn\\'t anything \\'grand\\' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn\\'t play at all so we had to do something stupid and \\'experimental\\'\\xa0... Syd was a genius, but I wouldn\\'t want to go back to playing \\' Interstellar Overdrive \\' for hours and hours.\" [311] Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s. [312] Gilmour\\'s guitar work Main article: David Gilmour \"While Waters was Floyd\\'s lyricist and conceptualist, Gilmour was the band\\'s voice and its main instrumental focus.\" [313] —Alan di Perna, in Guitar World , May 2006 Rolling Stone critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour\\'s guitar work as integral to Pink Floyd\\'s sound, [313] and described him as the most important guitarist of the 1970s, \"the missing link between Hendrix and Van Halen \". [314] Rolling Stone named him the 14th greatest guitarist of all time. [314] In 2006, Gilmour said of his technique: \"[My] fingers make a distinctive sound\\xa0... [they] aren\\'t very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable\\xa0... The way I play melodies is connected to things like Hank Marvin and the Shadows .\" [315] Gilmour\\'s ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis . [316] In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown described Gilmour\\'s guitar style as \"characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures.\" [316] According to Brown, Gilmour\\'s solos on \"Money\", \" Time \" and \" Comfortably Numb \" \"cut through the mix like a laser beam through fog.\" [316] Brown described the \"Time\" solo as \"a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development\\xa0... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step \\'over bends\\', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato.\" [317] Brown described Gilmour\\'s phrasing as intuitive and perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: \"I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting\\xa0... [to get] singing sustain\\xa0... you need to play loud—at or near the feedback threshold. It\\'s just so much more fun to play\\xa0... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade.\" [316] Sonic experimentation Throughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with their sound. Their second single, \"See Emily Play\" premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 12 May 1967. During the performance, the group first used an early quadraphonic device called an Azimuth Co-ordinator . [318] The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to manipulate the band\\'s amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect. [319] In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system. [320] Waters experimented with the VCS 3 synthesiser on Pink Floyd pieces such as \" On the Run \", \" Welcome to the Machine \", and \" In the Flesh? \". [321] He used a binson echorec 2 delay effect on his bass-guitar track for \" One of These Days \". [322] Pink Floyd used innovative sound effects and state of the art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut . Mason\\'s contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect. The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener\\'s head when they were wearing headphones. The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener\\'s ears. [323] Film scores Pink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with The Committee . [324] In 1969, they recorded the score for Barbet Schroeder \\'s film More . The soundtrack proved beneficial: not only did it pay well but, along with A Saucerful of Secrets , the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter. [325] While composing the soundtrack for director Michelangelo Antonioni \\'s film Zabriskie Point , the band stayed at a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month. Waters claimed that, without Antonioni\\'s constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less than a week. Eventually he used only three of their recordings. One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called \"The Violent Sequence\", later became \"Us and Them\", included on 1973\\'s The Dark Side of the Moon . [326] In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film La Vallée , for which they released a soundtrack album called Obscured by Clouds . They composed the material in about a week at the Château d\\'Hérouville near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd\\'s first album to break into the top\\xa050 on the US Billboard chart. [327] Live performances Main article: Pink Floyd live performances A live performance of The Dark Side of the Moon at Earls Court , shortly after its release in 1973: (l–r) Gilmour, Mason, Dick Parry , Waters Regarded as pioneers of live music performance and renowned for their lavish stage shows, Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, making use of innovative sound effects and quadraphonic speaker systems. [328] From their earliest days, they employed visual effects to accompany their psychedelic music while performing at venues such as the UFO Club in London. [34] Their slide-and-light show was one of the first in British rock, and it helped them become popular among London\\'s underground. [294] To celebrate the launch of the London Free School \\'s magazine International Times in 1966, they performed in front of 2,000 people at the opening of the Roundhouse , attended by celebrities including Paul McCartney and Marianne Faithfull . [329] In mid-1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band\\'s lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of polarisers , mirrors and stretched condoms . [330] After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a Ford Transit van, then considered extravagant band transportation. [331] On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream at the Alexandra Palace , London. Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around three o\\'clock in the morning after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just as the sun was beginning to rise. [332] [nb 53] In July 1969, precipitated by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television coverage of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, performing an instrumental piece which they called \" Moonhead \". [334] In November 1974, they employed for the first time the large circular screen that would become a staple of their live shows. [335] In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named \"Algie\". Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour. [336] The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album The Wall . The subsequent The Wall Tour featured a 40 feet (12\\xa0m) high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience. They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story. They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story. [337] One striking feature of the tour was the performance of \"Comfortably Numb\". While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall. When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him. Gilmour stood on a flightcase on castors, an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician. A large hydraulic platform supported both Gilmour and the tech. [338] During the Division Bell Tour , an unknown person using the name Publius posted a message on an internet newsgroup inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. White lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court on 20 October 1994, someone projected the word \"enigma\" in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that their record company had instigated the Publius Enigma mystery, rather than the band. [232] Lyrical themes Marked by Waters\\'s philosophical lyrics, Rolling Stone described Pink Floyd as \"purveyors of a distinctively dark vision\". [297] Author Jere O\\'Neill Surber wrote: \"their interests are truth and illusion, life and death, time and space, causality and chance, compassion and indifference.\" [339] Waters identified empathy as a central theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd. [340] Author George Reisch described Meddle \\'s psychedelic opus, \"Echoes\", as \"built around the core idea of genuine communication, sympathy , and collaboration with others.\" [341] Despite having been labelled \"the gloomiest man in rock\", author Deena Weinstein described Waters as an existentialist , dismissing the unfavourable moniker as the result of misinterpretation by music critics. [342] Disillusionment, absence, and non-being Waters\\'s lyrics to Wish You Were Here \\'s \" Have a Cigar \" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives. [343] The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes \"Pink\" is the name of one of the band members. [344] According to author David Detmer, the album\\'s lyrics deal with the \"dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce\", a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience. [345] Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters\\'s father, who died during the Second World War . Waters\\'s lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds , dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. [346] Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here : \"The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling.\" [347] [nb 54] Waters commented: \"it\\'s about none of us really being there\\xa0... [it] should have been called Wish We Were Here \". [348] O\\'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. [339] [nb 55] Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall , with the lyrics to \"Comfortably Numb\": \"I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone.\" [346] Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band\\'s catalogue, \"Jugband Blues\": \"I\\'m most obliged to you for making it clear that I\\'m not here.\" [346] Exploitation and oppression Author Patrick Croskery described Animals as a unique blend of the \"powerful sounds and suggestive themes\" of Dark Side with The Wall \\'s portrayal of artistic alienation. [350] He drew a parallel between the album\\'s political themes and that of Orwell\\'s Animal Farm . [350] Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: \"If you didn\\'t care what happened to me. And I didn\\'t care for you\", then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each. The lyrics ultimately paint a picture of dystopia , the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines. [351] The album\\'s characters include the \"Dogs\", representing fervent capitalists, the \"Pigs\", symbolising political corruption, and the \"Sheep\", who represent the exploited. [352] Croskery described the \"Sheep\" as being in a \"state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity\", a false consciousness . [353] The \"Dog\", in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone with no one to trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation. [354] Waters used Mary Whitehouse as an example of a \"Pig\"; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society. [355] At the album\\'s conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: \"You know that I care what happens to you. And I know that you care for me too.\" [356] However, he also acknowledges that the \"Pigs\" are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a \"Dog\" who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them. [357] Alienation, war, and insanity When I say, \"I\\'ll see you on the dark side of the moon\"\\xa0... what I mean [is]\\xa0... If you feel that you\\'re the only one\\xa0... that you seem crazy [because] you think everything is crazy, you\\'re not alone. [358] —Waters, quoted in Harris, 2005 O\\'Neill Surber compared the lyrics of Dark Side of the Moon \\'s \" Brain Damage \" with Karl Marx \\'s theory of self-alienation ; \"there\\'s someone in my head, but it\\'s not me.\" [359] [nb 56] The lyrics to Wish You Were Here \\'s \"Welcome to the Machine\" suggest what Marx called the alienation of the thing ; the song\\'s protagonist preoccupied with material possessions to the point that he becomes estranged from himself and others. [359] Allusions to the alienation of man\\'s species being can be found in Animals ; the \"Dog\" reduced to living instinctively as a non-human. [360] The \"Dogs\" become alienated from themselves to the extent that they justify their lack of integrity as a \"necessary and defensible\" position in \"a cutthroat world with no room for empathy or moral principle\" wrote Detmer. [361] Alienation from others is a consistent theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd, and it is a core element of The Wall . [359] War, viewed as the most severe consequence of the manifestation of alienation from others, is also a core element of The Wall , and a recurring theme in the band\\'s music. [362] Waters\\'s father died in combat during the Second World War, and his lyrics often alluded to the cost of war, including those from \" Corporal Clegg \" (1968), \" Free Four \" (1972), \" Us and Them \" (1973), \" When the Tigers Broke Free \" and \" The Fletcher Memorial Home \" from The Final Cut (1983), an album dedicated to his late father and subtitled A Requiem for the Postwar Dream . [363] The themes and composition of The Wall express Waters\\'s upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War, a condition that negatively affected his personal relationships with women. [364] Waters\\'s lyrics to The Dark Side of the Moon dealt with the pressures of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity. [365] He viewed the album\\'s explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition. [366] However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate positivity, calling it \"an exhortation\\xa0... to embrace the positive and reject the negative.\" [367] Reisch described The Wall as \"less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that create or cause madness.\" [368] The Wall \\'s protagonist, Pink, is unable to deal with the circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making. After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is \"crazy, over the rainbow\". [369] He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: \"have I been guilty all this time?\" [369] Realising his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him. He then stands trial for \"showing feelings of an almost human nature\", further exacerbating his alienation of species being. [370] As with the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault , Waters\\'s lyrics suggest Pink\\'s insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, \"custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies\", contribute to his angst, according to Reisch. [371] Legacy See also: List of awards and nominations received by Pink Floyd Pink Floyd\\'s The Wall exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Pink Floyd are one of the most commercially successful and influential rock bands of all time. [372] They have sold more than 250\\xa0million records worldwide, including 75\\xa0million certified units in the United States, and 37.9\\xa0million albums sold in the US since 1993. [373] [374] The Sunday Times Rich List , Music Millionaires 2013 (UK), ranked Waters at number 12 with an estimated fortune of £150\\xa0million, Gilmour at number 27 with £85\\xa0million and Mason at number 37 with £50\\xa0million. [375] In 2003, Rolling Stone \\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list included The Dark Side of the Moon at number 43, [376] The Wall at number 87, [377] Wish You Were Here at number 209, [378] and The Piper at the Gates of Dawn at number 347. [379] In 2004, on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, Rolling Stone included \" Comfortably Numb \" at number 314, \" Wish You Were Here \" at number 316, and \" Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2 \" at number 375. [380] In 2004, MSNBC ranked Pink Floyd number 8 on their list of \"The 10 Best Rock Bands Ever\". [381] In the same year, Q named Pink Floyd as the biggest band of all time according to \"a points system that measured sales of their biggest album, the scale of their biggest headlining show and the total number of weeks spent on the UK album chart\". [382] Rolling Stone ranked them number 51 on their list of \"The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". [383] VH1 ranked them number 18 in the list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". [384] Colin Larkin ranked Pink Floyd number 3 in his list of the \\'Top 50 Artists of All Time\\', a ranking based on the cumulative votes for each artist\\'s albums included in his All Time Top 1000 Albums . [385] In 2008, the head rock and pop critic of The Guardian , Alexis Petridis , wrote that the band occupy a unique place in progressive rock, stating, \"Thirty years on, prog is still persona non grata [...] Only Pink Floyd—never really a prog band, their penchant for long songs and \\'concepts\\' notwithstanding—are permitted into the 100 best album lists.\" [386] The writer Eric Olsen has called Pink Floyd \"the most eccentric and experimental multi-platinum band of the album rock era \". [387] Pink Floyd have won several awards. In 1981 audio engineer James Guthrie won the Grammy Award for \"Best Engineered Non-Classical Album\" for The Wall , and Roger Waters won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for \"Best Original Song Written for a Film\" in 1983 for \"Another Brick in the Wall\" from The Wall film . [388] In 1995, Pink Floyd won the Grammy for \"Best Rock Instrumental Performance\" for \" Marooned \". [389] In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Swedish Polar Music Prize for their contribution to modern music. [390] They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2010. [391] Pink Floyd have influenced numerous artists. David Bowie called Barrett a significant inspiration, and the Edge of U2 bought his first delay pedal after hearing the opening guitar chords to \" Dogs \" from Animals . [392] Other bands and artists who cite them as an influence include Queen , Radiohead , Steven Wilson , Marillion , Queensrÿche , Nine Inch Nails , the Orb and the Smashing Pumpkins . [393] Pink Floyd were an influence on the neo-prog subgenre which emerged in the 1980s. [394] The English rock band Mostly Autumn \"fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd\" in their sound. [395] Pink Floyd were admirers of the Monty Python comedy group, and helped finance their 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail . [396] In 2016, Pink Floyd became the second band (after the Beatles ) to feature on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail . [397] In May 2017, to mark the 50th anniversary of Pink Floyd\\'s first single, an audio-visual exhibition, Their Mortal Remains , opened at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. [398] The exhibition featured analysis of cover art, conceptual props from the stage shows, and photographs from Mason\\'s personal archive. [399] [400] Due to its success, it was extended for two weeks beyond its planned closing date of 1 October.

[4] ^ Leonard designed light machines, which used electric motors to spin perforated discs, casting patterns of lights on the walls. These would be demonstrated in an early edition of Tomorrow\\'s World . For a brief time, Leonard played keyboard with them using the front room of his flat for rehearsals. [8] ^ Wright also briefly lived at Leonard\\'s. [9] ^ Povey spelled it Meggadeaths but Blake spelled it Megadeaths. [11] Architectural Abdabs is sometimes suggested as another variation; Povey dismisses it as a misreading of a headline about the Abdabs in the Polytechnic\\'s student newspaper. [12] Povey used the Tea Set throughout whereas Blake\\'s claim of the alternative spelling, the T-Set, remains unsubstantiated. [13] ^ The four-song session became the band\\'s first demo and included the R&B classic \" I\\'m a King Bee \" (original of bluesman Slim Harpo , and three Syd Barrett originals, \"Butterfly\", \"Lucy Leave\" and \"Double O Bo\", a song Mason described as \"Bo Diddley meets the 007 theme\". [19] ^ According to Povey, by 1964 the group began calling itself the Abdabs. [9] ^ Soon after, someone stole the equipment, and the group resorted to purchasing new gear on a payment plan. [27] ^ They dropped the definite article from the band\\'s name at some point in early 1967. [37] ^ Schaffner described the £5,000 advance as generous; however, Povey suggested it was an inadequate agreement which required that the money be disbursed over five years. [40] ^ Previous to this session, on 11 and 12 January, they recorded a long take of \" Interstellar Overdrive \". [40] Sometime around the sessions on 29 January, they produced a short music film for \"Arnold Layne\" in Sussex. [41] ^ At EMI, Pink Floyd experimented with musique concrète and watched the Beatles record \" Lovely Rita \". [49] ^ Blackhill\\'s late application for work permits forced Pink Floyd to cancel several of the US dates. [57] ^ Pink Floyd released the single \" Apples and Oranges \" in November 1967 in the UK. [60] ^ Barrett\\'s absence on more than one occasion forced the band to book David O\\'List as his replacement. [62] Wynne-Willson left his position as lighting director and assisted the guitarist with his daily activities. [63] ^ In late 1967, Barrett suggested adding four new members; in the words of Waters: \"two freaks he\\'d met somewhere. One of them played the banjo, the other the saxophone\\xa0... [and] a couple of chick singers\". [66] ^ One of Gilmour\\'s first tasks was to mime Barrett\\'s guitar playing on an \"Apples and Oranges\" promotional film. [71] ^ Mason is unsure which member of Pink Floyd said \"let\\'s not bother\". [74] ^ For a short period after, Barrett turned up at occasional performances, apparently confused about his standing with the band. [80] ^ Thorgerson had attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys with Waters and Barrett. [88] ^ The band recorded their previous LPs using a four-track system; Atom Heart Mother was their first album recorded on an eight-track machine. [95] ^ A theft of the band\\'s equipment, worth about $40,000, after a May 1970 show at the Warehouse in New Orleans, nearly crippled their finances. However, hours after the band notified the FBI they had recovered most of the stolen equipment. ^ Povey states that the UK release date was 5 November, but Pink Floyd\\'s official website states 13 November. All sources agree on the US release date of 30 October. [106] ^ Meddle \\'s production consisted of sessions spread over several months; the band recorded in the first half of April, but in the latter half played at Doncaster and Norwich before returning to record at the end of the month. In May, they split their time between sessions at Abbey Road, rehearsals and concerts across Great Britain. They spent June and July performing at venues across Europe, and August in the far east and Australia, returning to Europe in September. [107] In October, they made the concert film Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii , before touring the US in November. [108] ^ Immediately after the session, Barrett attended a pre-party held for Gilmour\\'s upcoming first wedding, but eventually left without saying goodbye and none of the band members ever saw him again, apart from a run-in between Waters and Barrett a couple of years later. [139] The inspiration behind the cover image, designed by Thorgerson, is the idea that people tend to conceal their true feelings for fear of \"getting burned\", wrote Pink Floyd biographer Glen Povey. Therefore, it features two businessmen shown shaking hands; one of them is on fire. [140] ^ Brian Humphries engineered the album, which was completed in December 1976. [144] ^ The band commissioned a 30 feet (9.1\\xa0m) pig-shaped balloon and photography began on 2 December. Inclement weather delayed filming, and the balloon broke free of its moorings in strong winds. It eventually landed in Kent , where a local farmer recovered it, reportedly furious that it had frightened his cows. [146] The difficult shoot had resumed before they decided to superimpose the image of the pig onto the photograph of the power station. [147] ^ \"Pigs on the Wing\" contained references to Waters\\'s romantic relationship with Carolyne Anne Christie. [150] ^ Waters was not the only person depressed by playing in large venues, as Gilmour refused to perform the band\\'s usual encore that night. [155] ^ In 1976, Pink Floyd had become involved with financial advisers Norton Warburg Group (NWG). NWG became the band\\'s collecting agents and handled all financial planning, for an annual fee of about £300,000 (equivalent to £1,831,000 in 2021 [26] ). NWG invested between £1.6\\xa0million and £3.3\\xa0million of the band\\'s money in high-risk venture capital schemes, primarily to reduce their exposure to UK taxes. It soon became apparent that the band were still losing money. Not only did NWG invest in failing businesses, they also left the band liable for tax bills as high as 83 per cent of their income. The band eventually terminated their relationship with NWG and demanded the return of any funds not yet invested, which at that time amounted to £860,000; they received only £740,000. [159] Pink Floyd eventually sued NWG for £1M, accusing them of fraud and negligence. NWG collapsed in 1981: Andrew Warburg fled to Spain; Waterbrook purchased Norton Warburg Investments, and many of its holdings sold at a significant loss. Andrew Warburg began serving a three-year jail sentence upon his return to the UK in 1987. [159] ^ James Guthrie replaced engineer Brian Humphries, emotionally drained by his five years with the band, for the recording of the album. [162] In March 1979, the band\\'s dire financial situation demanded that they leave the UK for a year, or more and recording moved to the Super Bear Studios near Nice . [163] ^ Although Wright\\'s name did not appear anywhere on the finished album, Pink Floyd employed him as a paid musician on their subsequent The Wall tour. [168] Towards the end of The Wall sessions, Mason left the final mix to Waters, Gilmour, Ezrin and Guthrie, travelling to New York to record his debut solo album, Nick Mason\\'s Fictitious Sports . [169] ^ Waters took a six-week leave during filming and returned to find that Parker had used his artistic licence to modify parts of the film to his liking. Waters became incensed; the two fought, and Parker threatened to walk out. Gilmour urged Waters to reconsider his stance, reminding the bassist that he and the other band members were shareholders and directors and could outvote him on such decisions. [177] ^ Pink Floyd created a modified soundtrack for some of the film\\'s songs. [177] ^ Recording took place in eight studios, including Gilmour\\'s home studio at Hookend Manor and Waters\\'s home studio at East Sheen . [181] ^ During the sessions, Waters lost his temper and began ranting at Kamen who, out of frustration during one recording session, had started repeatedly writing \"I Must Not Fuck Sheep\" on a notepad in the studio\\'s control room. [180] ^ Waters commissioned his brother-in-law, Willie Christie, to take photographs for the album cover. [183] ^ Though Gilmour\\'s name did not appear on the production credits, he retained his pay as musician and producer. [187] ^ Released as a single, \" Not Now John \", with its chorus of \"Fuck all that\" bowdlerised to \"Stuff all that\"; Melody Maker declared it \"a milestone in the history of awfulness\". [189] ^ Wright was also in the midst of a difficult divorce and later said that the album was, \"made at a time in my life when I was lost.\" [192] ^ Waters went on to record the soundtrack for When the Wind Blows , as well as his second solo album, Radio K.A.O.S. . [195] ^ Artists such as Jon Carin and Phil Manzanera worked on the album, joined by Bob Ezrin. [202] ^ Andy Jackson engineered the album. [206] ^ Wright\\'s name appears only on the credit list. [213] ^ Gilmour divorced his wife Ginger and Mason married actress Annette Lynton. [222] ^ Thorgerson also provided six new pieces of film for the upcoming tour. [228] ^ Waters declined their invitation to join them as the tour reached Europe. [233] ^ In 1995, Pink Floyd released the live album, Pulse , and an accompanying concert video . [234] ^ In the week following their performance, there was a resurgence of commercial interest in Pink Floyd\\'s music, when according to HMV , sales of Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd rose more than one thousand per cent, while Amazon reported a significant increase in sales of The Wall . [240] Gilmour subsequently declared that he would give his share of profits from this sales boost to charity, urging other associated artists and record companies to do the same. [240] ^ In 2006, Gilmour began a tour of small concert venues with contributions from Wright and other musicians from the post-Waters Pink Floyd tours. Gilmour, Wright, and Mason\\'s encore performance of \"Wish You Were Here\" and \"Comfortably Numb\" marked the only appearance by Pink Floyd since Live\\xa08 as of 2012 [update] . [246] ^ Barrett left more than £1.25M in his will, to be divided among his immediate family, who then auctioned some of his possessions and artwork. [249] ^ Wright was not legally a band member after 1979, as a clause in his leaving agreement from 1979 prohibited him from rejoining the legal entity, and on 1987\\'s A Momentary Lapse of Reason he was listed as a supporting musician and omitted from the band photo. [288] However, from 1988\\'s Delicate Sound of Thunder onward, he was listed as a band member, even though the legal situation remained unchanged. [289] ^ In early 1965, Pink Floyd auditioned for ITV \\'s Ready Steady Go! , which Mason described as \"the definitive music show of the day\". [292] Despite sounding what Mason considered \"too radical for the general viewer\", they earned a callback for a second audition, with the caveat that they play material more familiar to the judges; they did not earn an appearance on the show. [293] Also in 1965, they auditioned for the Melody Maker Beat Contest, losing to the eventual national winners. [293] ^ Road manager Peter Watts joined them before touring Europe in 1968. [333] ^ Thorgerson\\'s design for Wish You Were Here \\'s cover included four sides, counting the inner jacket, which represented four absences related to the classical categories of substance : earth, air, fire and water. His Dark Side album cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The resulting refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity. [118] Absence is a key element in the existentialism of Albert Camus , who defined absurdity as the absence of a response to the individual\\'s need for unity. [118] ^ Philosophy originated from the Greek poet, Parmenides , who wrote a poem in which the protagonist takes a cosmic chariot ride guided by a goddess who shows him that there are only two paths in life, being, which leads to truth, and non-being, which leads to confusion and discontent. The goddess also told Parmenides: \"thought and being are one\". [349] ^ Marx considered insanity the ultimate form of self-alienation.

The group was founded in late 1965 by Syd Barrett on guitar and lead vocals, Nick Mason on drums, Roger Waters on bass and vocals, and Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals. Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour would later join the band in December 1967, while Barrett was ousted from the band in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health . From the 1970s onwards, they were augmented by additional personnel in the studio and on stage. Following creative tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1981, followed by Waters in 1985. Wright rejoined as a session musician and, later, band member. Mason is the only member to appear on all studio releases.

The British rock band Pink Floyd formed in 1965 and was at the forefront of 1960s psychedelia. They popularized the concept album for mass rock audiences in the 1970s. They experimented with their sound and incorporated sound effects, spacy guitar and keyboards, and extended improvisation in such songs as “Interstellar Overdrive.” Who were the original members of Pink Floyd? The principal members of Pink Floyd were lead guitarist Syd Barrett, bassist Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason, keyboard player Rick Wright, and guitarist David Gilmour. What was Pink Floyd\\'s first hit song? Pink Floyd\\'s first hit song was \"Arnold Layne,\" released in 1967. When was Pink Floyd inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? Pink Floyd was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Pink Floyd , British rock band at the forefront of 1960s psychedelia who later popularized the concept album for mass rock audiences in the 1970s. The principal members were lead guitarist Syd Barrett (original name Roger Keith Barrett; b. January 6, 1946,  Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England—d. July 7, 2006, Cambridge), bassist Roger Waters (b. September 6, 1943, Great Bookham, Surrey), drummer Nick Mason (b. January 27, 1945, Birmingham, West Midlands), keyboard player Rick Wright (in full Richard Wright; b. July 28, 1945, London—d. September 15, 2008, London), and guitarist David Gilmour (b. March 6, 1944, Cambridge). Formed in 1965, the band went through several name changes before combining the first names of a pair of Carolina bluesmen, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. Their initial direction came from vocalist-guitarist-songwriter Barrett, whose mixture of blues , music hall styles, Lewis Carroll references, and dissonant psychedelia established the band as a cornerstone of the British underground scene. They signed with EMI and early in 1967 had their first British hit with the controversial “ Arnold Layne,” a song about a transvestite. This was followed by their debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn , a lush, experimental record that has since become a rock classic. Their sound was becoming increasingly adventurous, incorporating sound effects, spacy guitar and keyboards, and extended improvisation such as “ Interstellar Overdrive.” By 1968 Barrett, who had overused LSD and was struggling with schizophrenia, was replaced by guitarist Gilmour. Without Barrett’s striking lyrics, the band moved away from the singles market to concentrate on live work, continuing its innovations in sound and lighting but with varying degrees of success. After recording a series of motion-picture soundtrack albums, they entered the American charts with Atom Heart Mother (1970) and Meddle (1971). Making records that were song-based but thematic in approach and that included long instrumental passages, the band did much to popularize the concept album. They hit the commercial jackpot with Dark Side of the Moon (1973). A bleak treatise on death and emotional breakdown underlined by Waters’s dark songwriting, it sent Pink Floyd soaring into the megastar bracket and remained in the American pop charts for more than a decade. The follow-up, Wish You Were Here (1975), included “ Shine On You Crazy Diamond,” a song for Barrett, and, though it went to number one in both the United States and Britain , it was considered anticlimactic and pompous by many critics. By the release of Animals (1977), it was clear that Waters had become the band’s dominant influence, and there was increasing internal conflict within Pink Floyd. Their sense of alienation (from both one another and contemporary society) was profoundly illustrated by the tour for 1979’s best-selling album The Wall , for which a real brick wall was built between the group and the audience during performance. After the appropriately named The Final Cut (1983), Pink Floyd became inactive, and legal wrangles ensued over ownership of the band’s name. Waters, who dismissed Wright after The Wall and took over most of the songwriting, was even more firmly in control. As a result the band split, but, much to Waters’s chagrin , Gilmour, Mason, and Wright reunited, continuing as Pink Floyd. In the late 1980s Wright, Gilmour, and Mason released two albums, including the ponderous A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994), while Waters pursued a solo career. Waters reunited with his former bandmates for a single performance at the Live 8 benefit concert in 2005. Gilmour and Mason later used recordings made with Wright (who died in 2008) to create what they said was the final Pink Floyd album, The Endless River (2014). Pink Floyd was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Lucy M. O\\'Brien Pink Floyd | The Official Site PRIVACY POLICY Remember a Day? The early Sixties. Everything is up in the air, not least love, drugs \\n            and sex. A group of talented teenagers from academic backgrounds in \\n            Cambridge — Roger \\'Syd\\' Barrett, Roger Waters and David Gilmour — \\n            are all keen guitarists and among many who move to London, keen to \\n            discover more of this new world and express themselves in it. Mainly \\n            in further education — studying the arts, architecture, music — they \\n            mix with like-minded incomers in the big city. In 1965, Barrett and Waters meet an experimental percussionist and \\n            an extraordinarily gifted keyboards-player — Nick Mason and Rick Wright \\n            respectively. The result is Pink Floyd, which more than 40 years later \\n            has moved from massive to almost mythic standing. Through several changes of personnel, through several musical phases, \\n            the band has earned a place on the ultimate roll call of rock, along \\n            with the Beatles, the Stones and Led Zeppelin. Their album sales have \\n            topped 250 million. In 2005, at Live 8 — the biggest global music \\n            event in history — the reunion of the four-man line-up that recorded \\n            most of the Floyd canon stole the show. And yet, true to their beginnings, \\n            there has always been an enigma at their heart. Roger \\'Syd\\' Barrett, for example. This cool and charismatic son of \\n            a university don was the original creative force behind the band (which \\n            he named after the Delta bluesmen Pink Anderson and Floyd Council). \\n            His vision was perfect for the times, and vice versa. He would lead \\n            the band to its first precarious fame, and damage himself irreparably \\n            along the way. And though the Floyd\\'s Barrett era only lasted three \\n            years, it always informed what they became. These were the summers of love, when LSD was less an hallucinogenic \\n            interval than a lifestyle choice for some young people, who found \\n            their culture in science fiction, the pastoral tradition, and a certain \\n            strain of the Victorian imagination. Drawing on such themes, the elfin \\n            Barrett wrote and sang on most of the early Floyd\\'s material, which \\n            made use of new techniques, such as tape-loops, feedback and echo \\n            delay. Live, the Floyd played sonic freak-outs — half-hidden by new-fangled \\n            light-shows and projections — with Barrett\\'s spacey lead guitar swooping \\n            over Waters\\' trance-like bass, while Wright and Mason created soundscapes \\n            above and beneath. On record they were tighter, if still \\'psychedelic\\'. \\n            Either way, they sounded \\'trippy\\'. And perhaps that was Barrett\\'s \\n            intention. He certainly ingested plenty of LSD and other drugs, which \\n            didn\\'t help his delicate mental balance. Over the spring of 1966, the young band were regulars at the Spontaneous \\n            Underground \\'happenings\\' on Sundays at the legendary Marquee Club, \\n            where they were spotted by their future managers Peter Jenner and \\n            Andrew King. And by the autumn, the Floyd had become the house band \\n            of the so-called London Free School in west London. A semi-residency at the All Saint\\'s Hall led to bigger bookings — \\n            at the UFO and the International Times \\' launch in the Roundhouse \\n            — as well as the recording of the instrumental \\'Interstellar \\n            Overdrive\\' with the UFO\\'s co-founder, producer Joe Boyd. (This track \\n            was later used on hip documentaries of the scene.) A signing to EMI \\n            followed in early 1967. \"We want to be pop stars,\" said Syd. In March, Boyd recorded \\n            Barrett\\'s oddly commercial \\'Arnold Layne\\' as a three-minute single. \\n            And with a Top Twenty hit to promote, the band took on a gruelling \\n            schedule of gigs and recordings. They appeared at the coolest event of the summer, The 14-Hour Technicolor \\n            Dream in Alexandra Palace. They gave a concert under the banner \\'Games \\n            for May\\' in a classical venue — the Queen Elizabeth Hall — where they \\n            displayed their theatrical ambitions through the use of props, pre-recorded \\n            tapes and the world\\'s first quadraphonic sound system. (They received \\n            a lifetime ban for throwing daffodils into the audience.) And in June \\n            the Floyd released a single originally written for this event. \\'See Emily Play\\', which was produced by EMI\\'s Norman Smith, charted \\n            at Number Six and made it on to primetime TV\\'s Top of the Pops three \\n            times (with Barrett acting increasingly strangely). This was followed \\n            in August by Pink Floyd\\'s first LP, The Piper At The Gates of Dawn , \\n            which they recorded at Abbey Road next door to the Beatles, then working \\n            on Sergeant Pepper . Again making the Top Ten, the album is \\n            mainly Barrett\\'s and is a precious relic of its time, a wonderful \\n            mix of the whimsical and weird. Talking of which, Barrett\\'s behaviour and output were threatening \\n            to bring the band down with him: refusing to speak, playing one de-tuned \\n            string all night, writing material like \\'Scream Thy Last Scream, Old \\n            Woman with a Basket\\'. The band wanted to keep their frontman and hoped \\n            he would recover himself, so they asked David Gilmour — now back in \\n            London after a sojourn abroad — to take over Syd\\'s role on stage, \\n            and thought Barrett might become their off-stage songwriter. They \\n            tried a few gigs as a five-piece. But in the end, they decided they \\n            could do without Barrett, and by March 1968 were in their second incarnation \\n            and under new management. Set the Controls Barrett went his way with Jenner and King, and later recorded two \\n            haunting solo albums — on which Waters, Wright and especially \\n            Gilmour helped — before retreating to Cambridge for the rest \\n            of his life. The other four acquired a new manager — Steve O\\'Rourke \\n            — and in a state of some consternation finished their second \\n            album, A Saucerful of Secrets (begun the previous year). Lyrical duties had now fallen to the bassist Roger Waters. And apart \\n            from \\'Jugband Blues\\' — a disturbing track by Barrett, who contributed \\n            little else — the album\\'s standout moments included the title track \\n            and Waters\\' \\'Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\'. This hypnotic epic signposted the style the band would expand on in \\n            the Seventies, its vision at first more appreciated by an \\'intellectual\\' \\n            and European audience. The Floyd played the first free concert in \\n            Hyde Park, and laid down the soundtrack for the bizarre Paul Jones \\n            movie vehicle, The Committee. They toured continually, developing \\n            new material on stage as well as in the studio. And they worked on the experience, in April 1969 revealing an early \\n            form of surround-sound at the Royal Festival Hall — their rebuilt \\n            \\'Azimuth Co-Ordinator\\'. (The prototype, first constructed and used \\n            in 1967, had been stolen.) They worked on their concepts, too - at \\n            that concert, performing two long pieces fusing old and new material, \\n            entitled \\'The Man\\' and \\'The Journey\\'. So their star continued its inevitable ascent. In July, the Floyd \\n            released More, less a soundtrack than an accompaniment to Barbet Schroder\\'s \\n            eponymous film about a group of hippies on the drug trail in Ibiza. \\n            The same month, they played live \\'atmospherics\\' to the BBC\\'s live \\n            coverage of the first moon landing. In November, they released the \\n            double-album Ummagumma , a mixture of live and studio tracks \\n            — and that same month reworked its outstanding number, the eerie \\n            \\'Careful With That Axe, Eugene\\', for Antonioni\\'s cult film Zabriskie \\n            Point. With Ummagumma at Number Five in the UK charts, and a growing \\n            reputation in both Europe and the US underground, the Floyd played \\n            some of the key festivals of their time — Bath, Antibes, Rotterdam, \\n            Montreux — and between October 1970 and November 1971, put out \\n            two more albums. Atom Heart Mother , their first Number One, featured the Floyd \\n            in their pomp — \\'I like a bit of pomp,\\' says Gilmour (who also \\n            made his first lyrical contribution with the gentle \\'Fat Old Sun\\'). \\n            And Meddle included two timeless and largely instrumental tracks \\n            that showcased their lead guitarist in all his vertiginous, keening \\n            glory: \\'Echoes\\', which took up the whole of Side One and began with \\n            a single \\'ping\\' created almost accidentally by Wright, and \\'One of \\n            These Days\\'. Increasingly successful, in 1972 the band was still pushing the boundaries. \\n            They shot the film \\'Live at Pompei\\' in a Roman amphitheatre, recorded \\n            another movie soundtrack for Schroder — Obscured by Clouds — and performed with the Ballet de Marseille. But more importantly, \\n            they began to work on an idea that would become their most popular \\n            album and with 45 million sold, the world\\'s third biggest. Provisionally entitled \\'Eclipse\\' and honed through an extensive world \\n            tour, The Dark Side of the Moon was released in March 1973, \\n            and defies a potted critique here. Demonstrating Waters\\' talents as \\n            both lyricist and conceptualist, it was also a musical tour de \\n            force by Gilmour. But Waters was becoming de facto leader \\n            of the band — which in public at least was becoming less about \\n            the individuals than the experience. That was (as Barrett had always intended) increasingly visual. The \\n            intriguing sleeve artwork commissioned from the ex-Cambridge outfit \\n            Hipgnosis was complemented by stage shows featuring crashing aeroplanes, \\n            circular projection screens and flaming gongs. There were backing \\n            singers on-stage and a guest slot for another pal from Cambridge, \\n            the saxophonist Dick Parry. In the dawning age of stadium rock, the \\n            Floyd were truly its masters. Or maybe its servants? Even before Dark Side broke Middle America \\n            through FM radio — with the single \\'Money\\' — alienation, \\n            isolation and mental fragility had long been Waters\\' themes. As a \\n            stadium performer, and a cog in the music business machine, he was \\n            becoming more prone to all three. As Barrett\\'s ex-colleague, he had \\n            seen them embodied in his old friend. The results were evident in \\n            two of his best lyrics — for \\'Shine On, You Crazy Diamond\\' and \\n            \\'Wish You Were Here\\'. These tracks were the high points of the Floyd\\'s \\n            next LP, also called Wish You Were Here , which was begun in \\n            January 1975 and released that summer. Famously, Barrett briefly appeared unannounced at Abbey Road during \\n            the recording of \\'Shine On\\' and shocked the band by his appearance \\n            and demeanour. It was the last time any of them saw him — but they \\n            were seeing less of each other, too. Personal and musical differences \\n            were starting to tell on the band, though it would be several years \\n            until these became unbearable — and two more LPs. Which One\\'s Pink? The first was Animals , released in January 1977 (although work \\n            had also begun on it in 1975). When this was toured with lavish special \\n            effects, including giant inflatables, Waters was dismayed that the \\n            crowds kept calling for old hits. In Montreal his patience snapped \\n            and he spat into the audience. It was a cathartic moment that gave \\n            birth to the Floyd\\'s most ambitious project ever: The Wall , \\n            a largely autobiographical reflection by Waters on the nature of love, \\n            life and art. The double album charts the progress of a rock star, \\'Pink\\', facing \\n            the break-up of his marriage while on tour. This leads him to review \\n            his life from the death of his father - like Waters\\' killed on the \\n            battlefield before he was born - to his spiteful teachers, his business, \\n            even his audience. He sees each as a brick in a metaphorical wall \\n            between him and the rest of the world. This wall intensifies his isolation, \\n            until he imagines the only solution is to become a fascist dictator. \\n            When he confronts his madness and deals with his issues, his torments \\n            cease and the wall crumbles. The show — in which the band were slowly obscured by a giant wall \\n            of cardboard \\'bricks\\' — was the most ambitious the rock world had \\n            ever seen, and was also turned into an Alan Parker film, starring \\n            Bob Geldof (who would return to the Floyd story 25 years later). The \\n            album sold 20 million, and spawned the band\\'s only Number One single, \\n            the anti-authoritarian \\'Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\\'. Though the album had its musical highlights — Gilmour\\'s solo on \\'Comfortably \\n            Numb\\' being the most memorable — it was largely a lyrical piece. Waters \\n            drove the project and the others fitted in. They ceded their vision \\n            to his increasingly personal direction, and worked together on no \\n            new material for more than two years. When they did get back in the studio, it was to record The Final \\n            Cut . This prophetically titled album, prompted by the Falklands \\n            conflict of 1982 and released the next year, explores themes of remembrance \\n            and the undelivered post-war dream — for which Waters\\' father \\n            had given his life. Completely credited to Waters, it was attributed \\n            to \\'Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd\\' and featured Gilmour\\'s \\n            vocals on one track. After three years — during which all four band members had pursued \\n            solo projects — Waters announced he was leaving the Floyd and \\n            disbanding them. Wright had left the legal entity some time before, \\n            transferring to the payroll for The Wall tour and playing no \\n            part in The Final Cut , but Gilmour and Mason decided to continue \\n            Pink Floyd without its erstwhile \\'leader\\'. A turbulent period followed, \\n            but agreement was eventually reached: Waters would continue to perform \\n            the songs on which he worked while he was with the band, as well as \\n            new solo material. Gilmour — now first among equals — and \\n            Mason would continue to record and perform with Wright as Pink Floyd. In 1987 came their next album, A Momentary Lapse of Reason — which emphatically proved that the Floyd could exist without \\n            Waters. The subsequent world tour, which also spawned the live Delicate \\n            Sound of Thunder , was the band\\'s longest and most successful ever. \\n            Over four years, 5.5 million people saw 200 shows, including one on \\n            a floating stage in Venice (which again earned them a venue-ban) while Thunder became the first rock album to be played in space, \\n            by the Soviet-French Soyuz-7 mission. 1994\\'s album and tour, The Division Bell , broke similar records; \\n            but more, it showed Gilmour and the band on a creative roll, with \\n            Wright contributing to some of the writing and Gilmour forging a new \\n            writing partnership with his wife, the novelist Polly Samson — \\n            \\'High Hopes\\' being one of their new classics. However, since then, \\n            the Floyd has recorded no new material in the studio. Not that they have been inactive — nor untouched by sorrows. \\n            In 2003, the band\\'s manager Steve O\\'Rourke died from a stroke and \\n            the three-man Floyd played \\'Fat Old Sun\\' and Dark Side \\'s \\'Great \\n            Gig in the Sky\\', at his funeral in Chichester Cathedral. In 2006, \\n            Syd Barrett died from pancreatic cancer. And in 2008 Rick Wright followed \\n            him — but not before he had helped re-write the Pink Floyd story \\n            a couple more times. In 2005, prompted by Bob Geldof, the band decided to perform at Live \\n            8 (on the 20th anniversary of Live Aid) and invited Waters to join \\n            them. He accepted and — sharing vocals with Gilmour — they \\n            played two numbers from Dark Side , plus \\'Wish You Were Here\\' \\n            and \\'Comfortably Numb\\'. It was an epoch-making moment in rock history, \\n            and their final group hug became one of Live 8\\'s iconic images. After that, the three-man Floyd performed together on two occasions \\n            — once during a solo gig by Gilmour in 2006 (Wright played the whole \\n            three-month tour and was \\'in great form\\', says Gilmour); and again \\n            at an all-star memorial tribute to Barrett in 2007. Waters also appeared \\n            at the gig but was unable to join his old colleagues due to a previous \\n            appointment. Still, that was not the end of their association. On 10 July 2010, with some of their favourite musicians, Waters and \\n            Gilmour performed a few Floyd songs — plus Phil Spector\\'s \\'To \\n            Know Him Is To Love Him\\'! — at a private charity event in Oxfordshire. \\n            And on 12 May 2011, during one of Waters\\' Wall concerts at \\n            the London O2, Gilmour appeared on top of the wall as of old, to sing \\n            and play his parts on \\'Comfortably Numb\\'. Nick Mason, who was at the \\n            gig, then joined them for the final song, \\'Outside the Wall\\'. Departing \\n            the stage, as they had before, Waters played trumpet, Gilmour mandolin \\n            and Mason tambourine. The audience was stunned and delighted. But a handful of concerts was never going to sate the interest of \\n            the diehard fans. In 1995, they were rewarded with the double-album P•U•L•S•E , all recorded on the Division Bell tour and \\n            containing the first complete live version of Dark Side . A \\n            live compilation of The Wall from 1980-1 — called Is \\n            There Anybody Out There? — followed in 2000, and then a re-mastered \\n            \\'best of\\', called Echoes . There have also been collectors\\' \\n            editions of Dark Side , a complete works box-set — Oh, \\n            By the Way — and now (autumn 2011) an extensive reissue campaign \\n            by EMI, with new packaging and production values, not to mention some \\n            rare and archival recordings that go back to the Barrett days. Nor, as individuals, have the survivors from those times been strangers \\n            to the studio or stage these last dozen or so years (and before). \\n            Gilmour put out his third solo album, On an Island , in 2006; \\n            Waters has had a prolific and varied career since 1986; Mason and \\n            Wright released one or two collaborative albums respectively. There have been awards and honours along the way: induction into both \\n            the US and UK Rock \\'n\\' Roll Halls of Fame; Sweden\\'s Polar Music Prize \\n            in 2008 for their \\'monumental contribution over the decades to the \\n            fusion of art and music in the development of popular culture\\'. And \\n            in 2010, The Royal Mail used Division Bell visuals on their \\n            stamps, also creating a unique sheet using only the Floyd\\'s imagery. So is that the end of the Floyd\\'s road? Do they still exist? Yes, they do. Who Sang the Most Pink Floyd Songs?

As one of rock\\'s most popular (and challenging) artists, the band has gone through many changes, all while consistently being innovative and ambitious. The power dynamics have never really been equal, but each member has helped to create the group\\'s unmistakable sound. Thanks to guitarist Syd Barrett , Pink Floyd, originally an R&B group, were quickly launched into the front lines of Britain\\'s psychedelic underground with the release of their debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn . Less than a year later, increased LSD use and mental illness halted Barrett\\'s prolific song output, and\\xa0the band members (now including replacement guitarist David Gilmour ) were torn between continuing his legacy and exploring new sounds for the remainder of the decade. After several successful experimental albums, the band fully embraced progressive rock under the leadership of bassist Roger Waters . The Waters-era was undoubtedly their most lucrative: The Dark Side of the Moon , Wish You Were Here and The Wall are among the top-selling and critically acclaimed albums of all time. Tensions in the band began to increase as Waters asserted more creative control for his increasingly personal concept albums. Founding member and keyboardist Richard Wright was eventually fired by Waters, who quit the band after recording his 1983 anti-war statement The Final Cut . Now a duo, Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason continued to record and release Pink Floyd albums into the \\'90s, when Wright rejoined. Their final album, The Endless River , was released in 2014, six years after Wright\\'s death. Everybody got a chance to sing lead vocal on at least one of the band\\'s songs , even during the Barrett-dominated \\'60s and the Waters-led \\'70s. Some of their best-known songs (like \"Have a Cigar\") actually use outside singers. The full lead-vocal breakdown is shown below.

Toc H.” (with Barrett and Wright) and “Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk” Pink Floyd\\'s psychedelic masterpiece was largely Barrett\\'s creation. By mid-1967, he had already authored two Top 20 U.K. singles (\"Arnold Layne\" and \"See Emily Play\") and 10 of the album\\'s 11 songs. Future band commander Rogers Waters makes his debut with the lone \"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk,\" while Mason and Wright\\'s contributions are limited to the two group-authored instrumental pieces, \"Interstellar Overdrive\" and \"Pow R. Toc H.\" (though Wright does share lead vocals with Barrett on two songs). \"Pow R. Toc H.\" features wordless vocals and howls by Barrett and Waters, and remained in the band\\'s set list until 1970. The group\\'s manager, Peter Jenner, recites the names of the planets through a megaphone on the spacey opening track, \"Astronomy Domine.\" By the end of the year, drug use and mental illness had taken its toll, and the resulting deficit of new songs made finding a replacement necessary. Friend of the band David Gilmour was hired in early 1968 to cover for Barrett, but he eventually found himself as the band\\'s main lead singer. A Saucerful of Secrets (1968) EMI Columbia EMI Columbia loading... Richard Wright – 3: “Let There Be More Light,” (with Waters and Gilmour), “Remember a Day,” and “See-Saw” David Gilmour – 2: “Let There Be More Light,” (with Waters and Wright) and “Corporal Clegg” (with Wright and Mason) Roger Waters - 2: “Let There Be More Light,” (with Gilmour and Wright) and “Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun” Syd Barrett - 1: \"Jugband Blues” Nick Mason – 1: “Corporal Clegg” (with Gilmour and Wright) With label pressure and Barrett\\'s deteriorating mental health, the rest of Pink Floyd found themselves increasingly responsible for writing their own songs. For their second album, every member gets a lead vocal, though Wright and Waters handled most of the songwriting. Waters, who contributed only one track to Piper , wrote the majority of the songs, but gave\\xa0many of the vocal duties to Gilmour, who had not yet written a song for the band. Wright makes his songwriting debut on this album, with the tracks “Remember a Day” (a leftover from the Piper sessions) and “See-Saw\"; Mason makes one of his few vocal contributions to Waters\\' first anti-war song “Corporal Clegg.” The album\\'s dark closing track, “Jugband Blues,” is Barrett\\'s final song with the band (although his bandmates would later play with him on his two solo albums in 1970). He was ousted from the\\xa0group two months before the album\\'s release. Soundtrack From the Film More (1969) More EMI Columbia loading... David Gilmour – 6: “Cirrus Minor,” “The Nile Song,” “Crying Song,” “Green Is the Colour,” “Cymbaline” and “Ibiza Bar” Pink Floyd\\'s popularity in England\\'s underground music scene had already secured them three soundtracks by 1969: San Francisco , Tonite Let\\'s All Make Love in London and The Committee . While none of these had an official soundtrack release until much later, the band decided to\\xa0issue another soundtrack as\\xa0its first album of 1969. The album was recorded in less than a month and was written almost exclusively by Waters. Unlike on the albums that followed, Waters gave vocal duties to Gilmour, who sings every\\xa0track on the record. His first song written for the band, “A Spanish Piece,” is a short pseudo-flamenco piece of incidental music with some vaguely Spanish mutterings. More contains some of the band\\'s heaviest material, but many of the songs are experimental pieces used to accompany the psychedelic imagery in the film. Ummagumma (1969) Harvest Harvest loading... Roger Waters - 1: “Granchester Meadows” David Gilmour – 1: “The Narrow Way” Pink Floyd\\'s first double album\\xa0contained half-live, half-studio cuts. The studio side features some of the group\\'s most experimental work. Unusually, each band member contributed a song (though only Gilmour\\'s \"The Narrow Way\" and Waters\\' \"Granchester Meadows\" have lyrics). Waters\\' other composition, \"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict,\" features some bizarre vocal effects that recall \"Pow R. Toc H.\" from their first album. The live half of the album\\xa0includes no\\xa0new songs. Zabriskie Point (1970) MGM MGM loading... David Gilmour – 2: “Country Song” and “Crumbling Land” (with Wright) Richard Wright – 1: “Crumbling Land” (with Gilmour) Unlike More , the original Zabriskie Point soundtrack included songs by other artists. Pink Floyd get the majority of\\xa0tracks, but one (“Country Song”) was left off at director Michelangelo Antonioni\\'s request.\\xa0The cut\\xa0was later appended to the album\\'s track listing on the 1997 reissue. Atom Heart Mother (1970) Harvest Harvest loading... David Gilmour – 1: “Fat Old Sun” Roger Waters - 1: “If” Richard Wright – 1: “Summer \\'68” Similar to the studio side of their previous album, Ummagumma , each band member (except for Mason) submitted a song for Atom Heart Mother . The lengthy extended pieces that bookend the album are both full-group compositions. The title track was composed with Ron Geesin and employed the Jon Alldis choir for the vocal sections. Geesin worked with Waters on Music From the Body , on which his bandmates contribute backing to\\xa0the song \"Give Birth to a Smile.\" Atom Heart Mother \\'s closing track, \"Alan\\'s Psychedelic Breakfast,\" features some incidental vocals by the band\\'s roadie, Alan Styles, who was recorded while making breakfast\\xa0as the band jams for 13 minutes. Relics (1971) Starline Starline loading... Roger Waters – 1: “Biding My Time” By 1971, Pink Floyd had toured the world and scored several hit albums and singles. Because their early singles were now hard to come by, a compilation of some of these rarities was put out for the new fans. Of the album\\'s 11 songs, only one was previously unreleased:\\xa0\"Biding My Time,\"\\xa0a Waters composition that was often incorporated into the band\\'s\\xa0live set around 1969 for an extended piece called \"The Man and the Journey.\" Meddle (1971) Harvest Harvest loading... David Gilmour – 4: “A Pillow of Winds,” “Fearless,” “Seamus” and “Echoes” (with Wright) Nick Mason – 1: “One of These Days” Roger Waters - 1: “San Tropez” Richard Wright – 1: “Echoes” (with Gilmour) Meddle is one of Pink Floyd\\'s most sonically diverse albums. It also is one of their best. Unlike most of their albums, much of the music was composed collaboratively; Waters\\' jazzy “San Tropez” is the only solo effort. Two of the album\\'s most enduring songs, the prog opus “Echoes” and the ominous opener “One of These Days,” were collaborations\\xa0among all of the\\xa0 band members. “One of These Days,” while mostly instrumental, features one of Mason\\'s most famous and disturbing vocal performances, albeit a spoken rather than sung one. The album\\'s penultimate track is a novelty blues ditty featuring barking by Steve Marriott \\'s dog Seamus. Obscured by Clouds (1972) Harvest Harvest loading... David Gilmour – 4: “Burning Bridges” (with Wright), “The Gold It\\'s in the ... ,” “Wot\\'s, Uh the Deal?” and “Childhood\\'s End” Richard Wright – 2: “Burning Bridges” (with Gilmour) and “Stay” Roger Waters - 1: “Free Four” More director\\xa0Barbet Schroeder once again approached Pink Floyd to provide music for his new film, La Vallée . This time, Pink Floyd released the album under a different title, leading to assumptions that it was a new studio album. Many of the songs are more straightforward than most Pink Floyd songs, though the closing track, \"Absolutely Curtains,\" contains a sample of the Mapuga tribe\\xa0that plays a role in the movie. The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) Harvest Harvest loading... David Gilmour – 4: “Breathe,” “Time” (with Wright), “Money” and “Us and Them” Roger Waters - 2: “Brain Damage” and “Eclipse” Richard Wright – 1: “Time” (with Gilmour) The iconic Dark Side of the Moon more or less was the beginning of the band\\'s Roger Waters era. The bassist wrote or co-wrote seven of the album\\'s 10 tracks, but vocals were still mostly being handled by Gilmour at this point; Waters sings only the two closing tracks solo. The album also includes several notable vocal performances by outside artists, most famously Clare Torry on “The Great Gig in the Sky” (all post-2005 reissues of the album actually co-credit her as songwriter along with Wright). Interspersed throughout the album are spoken-word samples of the band\\'s friends and contemporaries responding to questions written on note cards. These voices are\\xa0most noticeable in “On the Run” and “Brain Damage.” Wish You Were Here (1975) Harvest Harvest loading... David Gilmour – 2: “Welcome to the Machine” and “Wish You Were Here” Roger Waters - 2: “Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts I–V)\" and “Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts VI–IX)\" Roy Harper – 1: “Have a Cigar” After the monumental success of The Dark Side of the Moon , Pink Floyd\\xa0wrote a concept album about the music industry. The album also contains many references to founding member Syd Barrett (who coincidentally visited his former bandmates in the studio after several years of no contact). Like Dark Side , Wish You Were Here was a hit. The band again employed guest singers for a few songs: British folk\\xa0songwriter Roy Harper (the subject of a Led Zeppelin III song) takes over lead vocals on\\xa0“Have a Cigar,\" and\\xa0Ike\\xa0and Tina Turner collaborator Venetta Fields sings on “Shine On You Crazy Diamond.” Animals (1977) Harvest Harvest loading... Roger Waters - 5: “Pigs on the Wing (Part 1),” “Dogs” (with Gilmour), “Pigs (Three Different Ones),” “Sheep” and “Pigs on the Wing (Part 2) David Gilmour – 1: “Dogs” (with Waters) Pink Floyd\\'s winning streak continued with another Waters-penned concept album. Like Wish You Were Here , the album is bookended by a song\\xa0that serves to unify the album, though this time the tracks are\\xa0angry and political. Waters\\' personal and political beliefs would culminate on their next album, The Wall , but here he begins to implement his vision without much input from his bandmates; Gilmour sings only one song (which he co-wrote), \"Dogs.\" Wright, whose role in the band had significantly diminished since the early years, quit the band during the recording, though he would temporarily come back for their next album. The Wall (1979) Harvest Harvest loading... Roger Waters - 23: “In the Flesh?,” “The Thin Ice” (with Gilmour), \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1,” “The Happiest Days of Our Lives,” “Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2” (with Gilmour), “Mother” (with Gilmour), “Empty Spaces,” One of My Turns,” “Don\\'t Leave Me Now,” “Another Brick in the Wall, Part 3,” “Goodbye Cruel Wrold,” “Hey You” (with Gilmour), “Is There Anybody Out There?” (with Gilmour), “Nobody Home,” “Vera,” “Bring the Boys Back Home,” “Comfortably Numb” (with Gilmour), “In the Flesh,” “Run Like Hell” (with Gilmour), “Waiting for the Worms” (with Gilmour), “Stop,” “The Trial” and “Outside the Wall” David Gilmour – 11: “The Thin Ice” (with Waters), “Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2” (with Waters), “Mother” (with Waters), “Goodbye Blue Sky,” “Young Lust,” “Hey You” (with Waters), “Is There Anybody Out There?” (with Waters), “Comfortably Numb” (with Waters), “The Show Must Go On,” “Run Like Hell” (with Waters) and “Waiting for the Worms” (with Waters) Waters continued to assert his dominance over his bandmates during the sessions for his most complex work yet. Waters\\' sprawling double-album concept record contained some of the\\xa0band\\'s most ambitious and theatrical songs. Three years after its release in 1979, the album was adapted into a movie, and the band\\'s brief tour of Europe and North America in support of the LP featured complex visual effects. The album was a critical and commercial success too, topping the U.S. chart for 15 weeks. But relations among band members\\xa0wasn\\'t so great. Gilmour and Wright were recording solo albums at the same time,\\xa0while Waters left little room for his bandmates on his album. Tensions culminated when Waters fired Wright. Of the album\\'s 26 songs, Waters sings 23; Gilmour sings only three by himself. The Final Cut (1983) Harvest Harvest loading... Roger Waters - 12: \"The Post War Dream,\" “Your Possible Pasts,\" \"One of the Few,\" \"The Hero\\'s Return,\" \"The Gunner\\'s Dream,\" \"Paranoid Eyes,\" \"Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert,\" \"The Fletcher Memorial Home,\" \"Southampton Dock,\" \"The Final Cut,\" \"Not Now John\" (with Gilmour) and \"Two Suns in the Sunset\" David Gilmour – 1: \"Not Now John\" (with Waters) Waters made his mark with his last Pink Floyd album. For the first time, he sang and authored every song (except for \"Not Now John,\" on which Gilmour shares lead vocals). Waters even passed by Hipgnosis, a regular collaborator, for the cover art. Like The Wall , The Final Cut is a personal statement based on Waters\\' life and political beliefs. Specifically, the album deals with the then-current Falklands War and the death of\\xa0Waters\\' father on the battlefield in World War II. Tensions were high during the recording sessions; Mason and Gilmour contributed little to the album. This is the only Pink Floyd\\xa0LP without Wright. A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) EMI Columbia EMI Columbia loading... David Gilmour – 9: \"Signs of Life\" (with Mason), \"Learning to Fly,\" \"The Dogs of War,\" \"One Slip,\" \"On the Turning Away,\" \"Yet Another Movie,\" \"A New Machine (Part 1),\" \"A New Machine (Part 2)\" and \"Sorrow\" Nick Mason – 1: \"Signs of Life\" (with Gilmour) After writing the majority of Pink Floyd material for\\xa0much of the past decade, Roger Waters left the band in 1985. Wright, who was fired by Waters in 1979, returned for this album, but for legal reasons is not credited as a member. Gilmour stepped up as\\xa0chief songwriter and sings on all of the album\\'s non-instrumental tracks. Mason recites a poem on the opening track, marking his\\xa0final vocal performance with the band. The Division Bell (1994) EMI Columbia EMI Columbia loading... David Gilmour – 9: \"What Do You Want From Me,\" \"Poles Apart,\" \"A Great Day for Freedom,\" \"Wearing the Inside Out\" (with Wright), \"Take It Back,\" \"Coming Back to Life,\" \"Keep Talking,\" \"Lost for Words\" and \"High Hopes\" Richard Wright – 1: \"Wearing the Inside Out\" (with Gilmour) Like A Momentary Lapse of Reason , The Division Bell was released without any participation from Waters. Wright, who joined Gilmour and Mason for what turned out to be their last-recorded album, was\\xa0back in the band and received his first writing credit since 1975.\\xa0That song, “Wearing the Inside Out,” also features his only vocal on the album,\\xa0a co-lead with Gilmour. The album was certified triple platinum, and the successful world tour in support of it resulted in a No. 1 live album, Pulse . A leftover hour-long ambient piece from the sessions called “The Big Spliff” would eventually make its way onto the band\\'s last album, The Endless River , 20 years later. The Endless River (2014) Parlophone Parlophone loading... David Gilmour – 1: “Louder Than Words” The band\\'s final LP is partially composed of leftover pieces from their\\xa0previous album, The Division Bell . Again, Waters did not participate in the album\\'s creation (though he did briefly reunite with his bandmates onstage a few times in the \\'00s). Wright, who died in 2008, is credited as composer on many of the album\\'s tracks. Most of the album is filled with ambient sounds. Only one\\xa0track features\\xa0vocals: “Louder Than Words.” The opening track contains some spoken words, and “Talkin\\' Hawkin\\'” contains samples of physicist Stephen Hawking. Gilmour and Mason have both\\xa0said that The Endless River will be the last Pink Floyd album. The Early Years (2016) Pink Floyd Records Legacy Recordings Pink Floyd Records Legacy Recordings loading... Syd Barrett - 4: \"Arnold Layne,” “Candy and a Currant Bun,” “See Emily Play” and “Apples and Oranges” David Gilmour – 3: “Julia Dream,” “Point Me at the Sky” (with Waters) and “Embryo” Richard Wright – 2: “Paintbox” and “It Would Be So Nice” Roger Waters - 1: “Point Me at the Sky” (with Gilmour) Pink Floyd cleaned out their\\xa0vault with a\\xa0massive 33-disc compilation box set in 2106. While casual fans may not find much they know here, collectors and Barrett\\xa0devotees\\xa0rejoiced at the abundance of early singles (which are documented above) and previously unreleased recordings.\\xa0Among them are the band\\'s first six recordings from 1965, a scrapped single and live recordings from the group\\'s first seven years. The first disc includes both sides of their three non-album singles from 1967; the second disc collects the rest.\\xa0Some songs on the other discs found their way on albums, though only a handful of\\xa0these tracks\\xa0- like\\xa0“Embryo,”\\xa0first included on a label compilation - contain vocals. Non-Album Song: \"When the Tigers Broke Free\" (1982) Columbia Columbia loading... Roger Waters – 1: “When the Tigers Broke Free” Pink Floyd\\xa0hadn\\'t released an exclusive song as a single since 1968\\'s “Point Me at the Sky”/“Careful With That Axe, Eugene.” “When the Tigers Broke Free,” released in conjunction with the film Pink Floyd The Wall ,\\xa0featured The Wall track “Bring the Boys Back Home” as\\xa0its B-side. “When the Tigers Broke Free” was\\xa0originally written for The Wall ,\\xa0but Waters\\' bandmates dismissed it as \"too personal.\" Pink Floyd Who Sang the Most Songs? loading...

Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time. Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett\\'s leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind the band\\'s peak success with the albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall , Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards. Pink Floyd also composed several film scores. Following personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced two more albums— A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994)—and toured in support of both before entering a long hiatus. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a one-off performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River (2014), was based on unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions. In 2022, Gilmour and Mason reformed Pink Floyd to release the song \" Hey, Hey, Rise Up! \" in protest of the Russo-Ukrainian War. By 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and these albums and Wish You Were Here are among the best-selling albums of all time. Four Pink Floyd albums topped the US Billboard 200, and five topped the UK Album Chart. Pink Floyd\\'s hit singles include \" See Emily Play \" (1967), \" Money \" (1973), \" Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2 \" (1979), \" Not Now John \" (1983), \" On the Turning Away \" (1987) and \" High Hopes \" (1994). They were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize in Sweden for their contribution to modern music.

See the Last Living Members of Pink Floyd Now, at 76 and 78 Roger Waters, Nick Mason, and David Gilmour are still making music. By Lia Beck July 10, 2022 By Lia Beck July 10, 2022 Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images In 1965, four young men formed one of the first—and eventually one of the biggest—psychedelic rock bands: Pink Floyd . At its start, the band consisted of Syd Barrett , Roger Waters , Nick Mason , and Richard Wright . After a couple of years, guitarist David Gilmour also joined the group, only months before Barrett left in 1968. Now, the surviving members are Gilmour, Mason, and Waters, following the death of Barrett in 2006 and Wright in 2008. Recently, the band put out a new song, but not all three musicians participated in the release. That\\'s because there have long been tensions between two of them. Read on to find out about Gilmour, Mason, and Waters today, and where their relationships with each other stand. READ THIS NEXT: This Is the Most Hated Rock Band of All Time, According to Data . Pink Floyd has existed in different forms over the years. Koh Hasebe/Shinko Music/Getty Images Aside from Barrett leaving the band in the 1968, there have been some other lineup changes. Wright stopped performing with the group in the early 1980s, but then returned in the \\'90s. Meanwhile, Waters left the group in the mid-\\'80s and only returned in 2005 for the Live 8 concert, which all the members—minus Barrett—participated in. The band generally stopped performing as a full group in 1994, though Gilmour and Mason came together in 2013 for the album The Endless River , which included previously recorded material combined with new recordings. They also recently teamed up for another song. Two members have been feuding for years. Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images Gilmour and Waters have been at odds for some time. In a 2018 interview with Rolling Stone, Mason said of their feud , \"It\\'s a really odd thing in my opinion, but I think the problem is Roger doesn\\'t really respect David. He feels that writing is everything, and that guitar playing and the singing are something that, I won\\'t say anyone can do, but that everything should be judged on the writing rather than the playing.\" He added, \"I think it rankles with Roger that he made a sort of error in a way that he left the band assuming that without him it would fold.\" Mason said that he gets along with both band members and thinks \"it\\'s really disappointing that these rather elderly gentlemen are still at loggerheads.\" ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb David Gilmour has produced and played with other artists. Gus Stewart/Redferns via Getty Images All three remaining members of Pink Floyd have put out music outside of the band. Gilmour, 76, has released four solo albums with the latest, Rattle That Lock , released in 2015. He has also worked as a producer and played guitar for other artists. Earlier this year, Gilmour and Mason released the song \"Hey Hey, Rise Up!\" with the proceeds going to Ukrainian humanitarian efforts during the war. \"I rang Nick up and said: \\'Listen, I want to do this thing for Ukraine. I\\'d be really happy if you played on it and I\\'d also be really happy if you\\'d agree to us putting it out as Pink Floyd.\\' And he was absolutely on for that,\" Gilmour told The Guardian . As for his relationship with Waters, Gilmour told Rolling Stone in 2014, \"Why on Earth anyone thinks what we do now would have anything to do with him is a mystery to me. Roger was tired of being in a pop group. He is very used to being the sole power behind his career. The thought of him coming into something that has any form of democracy to it, he just wouldn\\'t be good at that.\" Gilmour has been married twice. He and artist Virginia Hasenbein were married from 1975 to 1990 and welcomed four children together. Since 1994, Gilmour has been married to writer Polly Samson , with whom he also has four kids. READ THIS NEXT: See the Last Surviving Beach Boys Now, at 79 and 81 . Nick Mason founded a Floyd spinoff band. Luke Walker/Getty Images Mason, Pink Floyd\\'s drummer, has released and performed music on his own, too. He released a solo album in 1981 and has also recorded with other musicians. In 2018, he created the band Nick Mason\\'s Saucerful of Secrets, which tours performances of Pink Floyd\\'s early music and is named after their second album. \"Syd had a strange way of writing, which made it sound like a \\'normal\\' pop song, and then it would lurch into something else,\" the 78-year-old told Billboard of performing Barrett\\'s compositions . \"[That] makes it such a great vehicle for us.\" As for his personal life, Mason was married to musician Lindy Rutter from 1968 to 1988, and they had two children. Then, in 1990, he married actor Nettie Mason and welcomed two more kids. For more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox, sign up for our daily newsletter . Roger Waters is touring right now. Kurt Krieger/Corbis via Getty Images Waters, 78, was a bassist and singer during his time in Pink Floyd. He left the band in 1985 but had already begun putting out solo work in 1984. He\\'s released four albums, and the most recent, Is This the Life We Really Want? , came out in 2017. Waters started his latest tour, titled This Is Not a Drill , in July 2022. In 2020, Rolling Stone asked Waters about playing both solo songs and Pink Floyd songs at his live shows. \"I hate to be the one to have to point this out to you, but they\\'re all my songs!\" he answered. \"I can throw together a setlist of any song that I ever wrote in my life, with the exception of some of the early ones.\" He also talked about the idea of getting back together with the band, saying, \"Obviously if you\\'re a fan of those days of Pink Floyd, well, then you have a different point of view. But I had to live through it. That was my life. I know in the wake of it I\\'ve been cast as something of a villain\\u2009…\\u2009so be it. I can live with that. But would I trade my liberty for those chains? No [expletive] way.\" Like his bandmates, Waters has been married before. He\\'s been wed five times—to Judith Trim , Lady Carolyne Christie , Priscilla Phillips, Laurie Durning , and, since 2021, to Kamilah Chavis . From his relationships, Waters has three children.

The Guardian has learned that the singer, 60, who suffered from a psychedelic-drug induced breakdown while at the peak of his career, died last Friday from cancer. His brother Alan confirmed his death, saying only: \"He died peacefully at home. There will be a private family funeral in the next few days.\" Born Roger Keith Barrett in Cambridge in 1946, he acquired the nickname Syd aged 15. He left Pink Floyd in 1968, just as the band was about to achieve worldwide recognition, and lived in the basement of his mother Winfred\\'s semi-detached house, where he boarded up the windows to keep out the eyes of both the press and fans. He recorded two solo albums. Pink Floyd\\'s Shine on You Crazy Diamond, from the 1975 album Wish You Were Here, was said by many to be a salute to him. Barrett\\'s use of drugs, particularly LSD, in the 60s, was well-documented and he was often described as the original acid casualty. A statement issued on behalf of Pink Floyd said: \"The band are naturally very upset and sad to learn of Syd Barrett\\'s death. Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire.\" Dave Gilmour, the Pink Floyd guitarist drafted in to the band during a period in which Barrett was behaving erratically, said in an interview earlier this year that he thought that Barrett\\'s breakdown would have happened anyway. He said: \"It was a deep-rooted thing. But I\\'ll say the psychedelic experience might well have acted as a catalyst. Still, I just don\\'t think he could deal with the vision of success and all the things that went with it.\" Explore more on these topics Culture Pink Floyd Pop and rock Psychedelia obituaries Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed Oscars 2024 Film Books Music Art & design TV & radio Stage Classical Games News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Back to top © 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A brief story of Pink Floyd, prior to the Polar Music Prize Ceremony in August 2008. Both Waters and Mason were original members of Pink Floyd in 1965. They can look back on a tremendous career in music, creatively as well as in commercial terms. The albums Pink Floyd made, especially during the 1970s, are among the most innovative, influential and commercially successful records ever were made in rock history. The Dark Side of the Moon\\xa0(1973), Wish You Were Here\\xa0(1975) and The Wall\\xa0(1979) are still among the world’s most popular and respected rock albums. But the group’s history started much earlier. And it went on for much longer. The origin of Pink Floyd is in 1963-64 London. Roger Waters and drummer Nick Mason met while they were studying architecture at the London Polytechnic in Regent Street. So did keyboard player Rick Wright, and they played together in Pink Floyd’s predecessor, Sigma 6. Syd Barrett, an old friend of Waters from Cambridge who also played the guitar and was in London studying art, joined the band in 1965. London Polytechnic at Regent Street in London where Nick Mason and Roger Waters studied architecture, 1963-64. (Source: Wikimedia Commons ) They called themselves the Tea Set and played mainly rhythm and blues songs. In late 1965 they became the resident band at the Countdown Club in London, playing from late night until early morning, three sets of 90 minutes each. Now they realised that songs could be extended with lengthy solos. The name Pink Floyd was created on the spur of a moment by Syd Barrett, when another band, also called the Tea Set, was to perform at one of their gigs. The name came from two blues musicians in Barrett’s record collection; Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. Syd Barret, Nick Mason, Rick Wright and Roger Waters, 1967. Pink Anderson, one of the two blues musicians whose name inspired Syd Barrett to call the band Pink Floyd. (Source: © Bluesville/Original Blues Classics ) By 1967 Pink Floyd had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound; long, loud suitlike compositions that touched on hard rock, blues, country, folk, electronic and classical music. Adding a slide-and-light show, one of the first in British rock, they became a sensation among London’s underground as a featured attraction at the UFO Club. Syd Barrett, who wrote most of the band’s early material, had a talent for composing singles-length bits of psychedelia, and they had hits with two of them in 1967: “Arnold Layne” (#20 U.K.), the tale of a transvestite and “See Emily Play” (#6 U.K.). The latter, however, was the last hit single they would have for over a decade. Space-epic titles like “Astronomy Domine” and “Interstellar Overdrive” were more typical. Their first album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, was released in August 1967, recorded in EMI Studios at Abbey Road. Pink Floyd in 1967, the four piece band with Syd Barrett (far right).

(Source: Wikipedia/pink-floyd.org ) \"Astronomy Domine\", Pink Floyd live on Belgian TV, 1968 Around mid 1967, Syd Barrett began showing increasingly alarming signs of mental instability, allegedly because of an excess of LSD experimentation. He would go catatonic on stage, playing music that had little to do with the material, or not playing at all. An American tour had to be cut short when he was barely able to function at all. Around the beginning of 1968, guitarist David Gilmour, a friend of the band who was also from Cambridge, was brought in as a fifth member. The idea was that Gilmour would enable Pink Floyd to continue as a live band; Barrett would still be able to write and contribute to the records. That didn’t work either, and within a few months Barrett was out of the group. It was a hard blow for Pink Floyd – but early in the game yet. Pink Floyds second album, \"A Saucerful of Secrets\" released in June 1968 Pink Floyd went through a huge development from the late ‘60s into the ‘70s. They moved from Barrett’s concise and vivid songs to spacy, ethereal material with lengthy instrumental passages. Their third release Ummagumma (1969) was a double album, one live and one studio record, showing a more skilful and musically developed group, and with a sound that was much louder and harder. \"Ummagumma\", 1969 \"Atom Heart Mother\"\\xa0(1970) goes even further, starting with a side-long, 23-minute extended orchestral piece. In 1970 Pink Floyd toured extensively across America and Europe. 1971’s album \"Meddle\"\\xa0is considered to be their strongest record between Barrett’s departure and \"The Dark Side of the Moon.\"\\xa0The 1973 album with its iconic refracting prism design on the cover became Pink Floyd’s definite breakthrough – one of the most commercially successful rock albums of all time. \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", released in March 1973. Artwork by Hipgnosis and George Hardie. Documentary about the recording of \"The Dark Side of the Moon.\" \"The Dark Side of the Moon\"\\xa0was a hard act to follow. After extensive touring, Pink Floyd returned to the studio in 1975 to record their ninth studio album, which became \"Wish You Were Here\", highlighted by a melancholy tribute to the long-departed Barrett, “Shine On You Crazy Diamond”. The lyrical themes on \"The Dark Side of the Moon\"\\xa0had been insecurity, fear and the cold sterility of modern life. \"Wish You Were Here\"\\xa0and 1977’s \"Animals\"\\xa0explored these themes even more explicitly. Now, Roger Waters was the conceptual leader of Pink Floyd. \"Wish You Were Here\", released in 1975. Artwork by Hipgnosis. Cover of \"Animals\" (1977), with the Battersea Power Station and the pig in the sky. \"Bricks in the Wall\"\\xa0was one of two conceptual ideas that Roger Waters presented to the group in 1978 for the next album – about the material and emotional walls modern humans build around themselves for survival. The other idea would later become Waters’ first solo album, “The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking.” Pink Floyd in the mid 1970s (Source: © EMI Music ) Both Mason and Gilmour chose the former idea for the new album. \"The Wall\" (1979) became a huge success, especially in the U.S – in part because the music was losing some of its heavy duty electronic textures in favour of more approachable pop elements. It was largely a lyrical piece. The show was the most ambitious the rock world had ever seen and it was also turned into a film by Alan Parker. Keyboard player Rick Wright was very passive during the recording, and left the band as a result. \"The Wall\", released in November 1979. \"The Final Cut\"\\xa0was released in 1983 and looked like it would be Pink Floyd’s final album. It was almost entirely Roger Waters’ – the concept, the lyrics, all compositions – although Gilmour and Mason played on it. It is dedicated to Waters’ father who was killed in World War II, and is critical to Margaret Thatcher’s response to the invasion of the Falklands. It got mixed reviews but was commercially a success. Following the album\\'s release, each member of the band concentrated on solo projects, but Waters then announced that he had left the group, and later attempted to keep Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason from using the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour fought back legally and in 1987 he recorded \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\", Pink Floyd\\'s first album without Waters – with Rick Wright back in the band, Nick Mason still there and with the assistance of several songwriters. \"The Final Cut\", 1983 \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\", the first Pink Floyd album after Roger Waters left the band. Another David Gilmour-fronted Pink Floyd album, \"The Division Bell\", was released in 1994 and became a number one album in both the U.K. and U.S. But after the following tour, on which they played \"The Dark Side of the Moon\"\\xa0in its entirety, no more studio recordings of Pink Floyd have been made. The probably final Pink Floyd studio album, \"The Division Bell\", released in 1994. The dispute with Roger Waters was settled legally at the end of 1987. The parties reached an agreement where Mason and Gilmour retained the right to use the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall. In 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright reunited to perform at the Live 8 concert in London’s Hyde Park and later on in 2011 at the O2 Arena also in London. Syd Barrett and Rick Wright passed away, respectively, in 2006 and 2008.

They are known for philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation , innovative cover art, and elaborate live shows. One of rock music\\'s most successful acts, the group have sold over 200 million albums worldwide [6] [7] including 74.5 million albums in the United States alone. [8] Pink Floyd had moderate mainstream success and was one of the most popular bands in the London underground music scene in the late 1960s as a psychedelic band led by Syd Barrett; however, Barrett\\'s erratic behavior eventually forced his colleagues to replace him with guitarist and singer David Gilmour. After Barrett\\'s departure, singer and bass player Roger Waters gradually became the dominant and driving force in the mid-1970s, until his eventual departure from the group in 1985. The band recorded several albums, achieving worldwide success with The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), and The Wall (1979). In 1985, Waters declared Pink Floyd \"a spent force,\" but the remaining members, led by Gilmour, continued recording and touring under the name Pink Floyd. Although they were unsuccessfully sued by Waters for rights to the name, they again enjoyed worldwide success with A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987), and The Division Bell (1994). Eventually they reached a settlement out of court with Waters allowing them use of the name. Waters performed with the band for the first time in 24 years on July 2, 2005 at the London Live 8 concert.

Its lyrics are often ironic, even cynical—a protest against the crassness of modernity. Band history Syd Barrett – led era: 1964–1968 Pink Floyd evolved from an earlier rock band, formed in 1964, [9] [10] which was at various times called Sigma 6, the Meggadeaths, The Tea Set (or The T-Set), The Architectural Abdabs, The Abdabs and The Screaming Abdabs. When the band split up, some members—guitarists Rado \"Bob\" Klose and Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason, and wind instrument player Rick Wright—formed a new band called \"Tea Set.\" After a brief stint with a lead vocalist named Chris Dennis, [11] blues and folk guitarist and vocalist Syd Barrett joined the band, with Waters moving to bass. [12] When Tea Set found themselves on the same bill as another band with the same name, Barrett came up with the alternative name The Pink Floyd Sound , after two blues musicians, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. [13] For a time after this they oscillated between The Tea Set and The Pink Floyd Sound, with the latter name eventually winning out. The Sound was dropped fairly quickly, but the definite article was still used regularly until 1970. The group\\'s UK releases during the Syd Barrett era credited them as The Pink Floyd as did their first two U.S. singles. The 1969 More and Ummagumma albums credit the band as Pink Floyd, produced by The Pink Floyd, while the 1970 Atom Heart Mother credits the band as The Pink Floyd, produced by Pink Floyd! David Gilmour is known to have referred to the group as The Pink Floyd as late as 1984. [14] The heavily jazz -oriented Klose left after recording only a demo, [15] leaving an otherwise stable lineup with Barrett on guitar and lead vocals, Waters on bass guitar and backing vocals, Mason on drums and percussion, and Wright switching to keyboards and backing vocals. Barrett soon started writing his own songs, influenced by American and British psychedelic rock with his own brand of whimsical humor. Pink Floyd became a favorite in the underground movement, playing at such prominent venues as the UFO club, the Marquee Club and the Roundhouse. At the end of 1966 the band were invited to contribute music for Peter Whitehead\\'s film Tonite Let\\'s All Make Love In London ; they were filmed recording two tracks (\"Interstellar Overdrive\" and \"Nick\\'s Boogie\") in January 1967. Although hardly any of this music made it onto the film, the session was eventually released as London \\'66/\\'67 in 2005. As their popularity increased, the band members formed Blackhill Enterprises in October 1966, a six-way business partnership with their managers, Peter Jenner and Andrew King, [16] issuing the singles \"Arnold Layne\" in March 1967 and \"See Emily Play\" in June 1967. \"Arnold Layne\" reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart, and \"See Emily Play\" reached number 6, [17] granting the band its first national TV appearance on Top of the Pops in July 1967. (They had earlier appeared, performing \"Interstellar Overdrive\" at the UFO Club, in a short documentary, \"It\\'s So Far Out It\\'s Straight Down.\" This was broadcast in March 1967 but seen only in the UK\\'s Granada TV region.). Released in August 1967, the band\\'s debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, is today considered to be a prime example of British psychedelic music, and was generally well-received by critics at the time. It is now viewed as one of the best debut albums by many critics. [18] The album\\'s tracks, predominantly written by Barrett, showcase poetic lyrics and an eclectic mixture of music, from the avant-garde free-form piece \"Interstellar Overdrive\" to whimsical songs such as \"The Scarecrow (Pink Floyd song),\" inspired by the Fenlands, a rural region north of Cambridge (Barrett, Gilmour and Waters\\'s home town). Lyrics were entirely surreal and often referred to folklore, such as \"The Gnome.\" The music reflected newer technologies in electronics through its prominent use of stereo panning, tape editing, echo effects (specifically, a Binson Echorec machine) and electric keyboards. The album was a hit in the UK where it peaked at #6, but did not do well in North America, reaching #131 in the U.S., [19] and that only after it was reissued in the wake of the band\\'s state side commercial breakthrough in the 1970s. During this period, the band toured with Jimi Hendrix , which helped to increase its popularity. Barrett\\'s decline As the band became more popular, the stresses of life on the road, pressure by the record company to produce hit singles, and a significant intake of psychedelic drugs took their toll on Barrett, whose mental health had been deteriorating for several months. [20] In January 1968, guitarist David Gilmour joined the band to carry out Barrett\\'s playing and singing duties, though Jeff Beck was originally considered. [21] With Barrett\\'s behavior becoming less and less predictable, and his almost constant use of LSD, he became very unstable, occasionally staring into space while the rest of the band performed. During some performances, he would just strum one chord for the duration of a concert, or randomly begin detuning his guitar. [22] He was also equally erratic in rehearsals; on one occasion he was, according to band members, perfectly on the ball and ready to record while preparing, yet as soon as the recording began he would stare into space. When recording was cut, he became, as Waters describes him, \"the usual jack-the-lad, hopping around on the balls of his feet.\" The absent expression in his eyes inspired Waters\\' lyrics in 1975\\'s \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\" \"Now there\\'s that look in your eyes/ Like black holes in the sky.\\' The band\\'s live shows became increasingly ramshackle until, eventually, the other band members simply stopped taking him to the concerts. The last concert featuring Barrett was on January 20 1968 on Hastings Pier. It was originally hoped that Barrett would write for the band with Gilmour performing live, but Barrett\\'s increasingly difficult compositions, such as \"Have You Got It, Yet?\", which changed melodies and chord progression with every take, eventually made the rest of the band give up on this arrangement. [23] Once Barrett\\'s departure was formalized in April 1968, producers Jenner and King decided to remain with him, and the six-way Blackhill partnership was dissolved. [23] The band adopted Steve O\\'Rourke as manager, and he remained with Pink Floyd until his death in 2003. After recording two solo albums ( The Madcap Laughs and Barrett (album) ) in 1970 (co-produced by and sometimes featuring Gilmour, Waters and Wright) to moderate success, Barrett went into seclusion. Again going by his given name, Roger, he eventually moved back to his native Cambridge and lived a quiet life there until his death on July 7, 2006. Finding their feet: 1968–1970 This period was one of musical experimentation for the band. Gilmour, Waters and Wright each contributed material that had its own voice and sound, giving this material less consistency than the Barrett-dominated early years or the more polished, collaborative sound of later years. As Barrett had been the lead singer during his era, Gilmour, Waters and Wright now split both songwriting and lead vocal duties. Waters mostly wrote low-key, jazzy melodies with dominant bass lines and complex, symbolic lyrics, Gilmour focused on guitar-driven blues jams, and Wright preferred melodic psychedelic keyboard-heavy numbers. Unlike Waters, Gilmour and Wright preferred tracks that had simple lyrics or that were purely instrumental. Some of the band\\'s most experimental music is from this period, such as \"A Saucerful of Secrets,\" consisting largely of noises, feedback, percussions, oscillators and tape loops, and \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\" (which went by a number of other names as well), a very Waters-driven song with a bass and keyboard-heavy jam culminating in crashing drums and Waters\\' primal screams. The double album Ummagumma, was a mix of live recordings and unchecked studio experimentation by the band members, with each member recording half a side of a vinyl record as a solo project (Mason\\'s first wife makes an uncredited contribution as a flautist). [24] Though the album was realized as solo outings and a live set, it was originally intended as a purely avant-garde mixture of sounds from \"found\" instruments. The subsequent difficulties in recording and lack of group organization led to the shelving of the project. In 1970 Atom Heart Mother, the band\\'s first recording with an orchestra , was a collaboration with avant-garde composer Ron Geesin. The name was a last minute decision by the band when they were inspired by a newspaper article about a woman who had given birth with a pacemaker. The cover was equally as unplanned, with the photographer claiming to have \"gone out into the countryside and taking a picture of the first thing he saw.\" One side of the album consisted of the title piece, a 23-minute long \"rock-orchestral\" suite. One lengthy piece, \"Alan\\'s Psychedelic Breakfast,\" was a sound collage of a man cooking and eating breakfast and his thoughts on the matter, linked with instrumentals. The man was Alan Stiles, one of Pink Floyd\\'s roadies at the time. The use of noises, incidental sound effects and voice samples would thereafter be an important part of the band\\'s sound. While Atom Heart Mother was considered a huge step back for the band at the time [25] and is still considered one of its most inaccessible albums, it had the best chart performance for the band up to that time, reaching #1 in the UK and #55 in the U.S. [19] The popularity of the album allowed Pink Floyd to embark on its first full U.S. tour. Breakthrough era: 1971–1975 During this time, Pink Floyd shed their association with the \"psychedelic\" scene and became a distinctive band who were difficult to classify. The divergent styles of their primary songwriters, Gilmour, Waters and Wright, merged into a unique sound, which quickly became known among fans as \"The Pink Floyd Sound.\" This era contains what many consider to be two of the band\\'s masterpiece albums, The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. Pink Floyd, Earls Court, 1973 The sound became polished and collaborative, with the philosophic lyrics and distinctive bass lines of Waters combining with the unique blues guitar style of Gilmour and Wright\\'s haunting keyboard melodies, and harmonic textures. Gilmour was the dominant vocalist throughout this period, and female choirs and Dick Parry\\'s saxophone contributions became a notable part of the band\\'s style. The sometimes atonal and harsh sound exhibited in the band\\'s earlier years gave way to a very smooth, mellow and soothing sound, and the band\\'s epic, lengthy compositions reached their zenith with \"Echoes.\" This period was not only the beginning but the end of the truly collaborative era of the band; after 1973 Waters\\' influence became more dominant musically as well as lyrically. Wright\\'s last credited composition and last lead vocal on a studio album until 1994\\'s The Division Bell were in this period (\"Time\" and \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" respectively), and Gilmour\\'s writing credits sharply declined in frequency until Waters left the band in 1985, though he continued to perform lead vocals and write songs throughout the whole time. The last ties with Barrett were severed in musical fashion with Wish You Were Here, whose epic track \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" was written both as a tribute and eulogy to Barrett. The epic, 26-minute piece was described by Gilmour as \"Roger\\'s paean to Syd.\" The band\\'s sound was considerably more focused on Meddle (1971), with the 23-minute epic \"Echoes\" taking up the second side of the LP. \"Echoes\" is a smooth progressive rock song with extended guitar and keyboard solos and a long segue in the middle consisting largely of synthesized music produced on guitars, organs, and synths, along with backward wah pedal guitar sounding like samples of sea gulls or albatross and an entire whale song playing over the top, described by Waters as a \"sonic poem.\" [26] The song took a while to construct, and went through many named stages, including \"Nothings,\" \"Son Of Nothings\" and \"Return Of The Son Of Nothings.\" The latter was performed at their free Hyde Park concert and was well received by the crowd. Meddle was considered by Nick Mason to be \"the first real Pink Floyd album. It introduced the idea of a theme that can be returned to.\" [27] The album had the sound and style of the succeeding breakthrough-era Pink Floyd albums but stripped away the orchestra that was prominent in Atom Heart Mother . [28] Meddle also included the atmospheric \"One of These Days,\" a concert favorite featuring Nick Mason\\'s menacing one-line vocal (\"One of these days, I\\'m going to cut you into little pieces\"), distorted and bluesy lap steel guitar, and a melody that at one point fades into a throbbing synthetic pulse quoting the theme tune of the cult classic science fiction television show Doctor Who . The mellow feeling of the next three albums is very present on \"Fearless,\" and this track displays a folk influence, as does the prominent lap steel guitar on \"A Pillow of Winds.\" Waters\\' role as lead songwriter began to take form, with his jazzy \"San Tropez\" brought to the band practically completed and ready to record. Meddle was greeted both by critics [29] and fans enthusiastically, and Pink Floyd were rewarded with a #3 album chart peak in the UK; it only reached #70 in U.S. charts. [19] According to Nick Mason, this was partly because Capitol Records had not provided the album with enough publicity support in the U.S. [30] Today, Meddle remains one of their most well-regarded efforts. The release of Pink Floyd\\'s massively successful 1973 album, The Dark Side of the Moon, was a watershed moment in the band\\'s popularity. Pink Floyd had stopped issuing singles after 1968\\'s \"Point Me at the Sky\" and was never a hit-single-driven group, but The Dark Side of the Moon featured a U.S. Top 20 single (\"Money\"). [17] . The album became the band\\'s first #1 on U.S. charts [19] and, as of December 2006, is one of the biggest-selling albums in U.S. history, with more than 15 million units sold, [8] and one of the best-selling albums worldwide, with more than 40 million copies sold. [19] The critically-acclaimed album stayed on the Billboard Top 200 for an unprecedented 741 weeks (including 591 consecutive weeks from 1976 to 1988), [31] establishing a world record. It also remained 301 weeks on UK charts, despite never rising higher than #2 there, and is highly praised by critics. Saxophone forms an important part of the album\\'s sound, exposing the band\\'s jazz influences (especially that of Rick Wright), and female backing vocals play a key role in helping to diversify the album\\'s texture. For example, songs such as \"Money\" and \"Time\" are placed on either side of mellow lap steel guitar sounds (reminiscent of Meddle ) in \"Breathe (Reprise)\" and female vocal-laden song \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" (with Clare Torry on lead vocal), while minimalist instrumental \"On the Run\"\\nis performed almost entirely on a single synthesizer. Incidental sound effects and snippets of interviews feature alongside the music, many of them taped in the studio. Waters\\' interviews started out with questions like \"What is your favorite color?\" in an attempt to get the person comfortable. He would then ask, \"When was the last time you were violent? Were you in the right?\" The latter answer was played on the album. Other interviews would ask, \"Are you afraid of dying?\" The album\\'s lyrics and sound attempt to describe the different pressures that everyday life places upon human beings. This concept (conceived by Waters in a band meeting around Mason\\'s kitchen table) [32] proved a powerful catalyst for the band and together they drew up a list of themes, several of which would be revisited by Waters on later albums, such as \"Us and Them\"\\'s musings on violence and the futility of war, and the themes of insanity and neurosis discussed in \"Brain Damage.\" The album\\'s complicated and precise sound engineering by Alan Parsons set new standards for sound fidelity; this trait became a recognizable aspect of the band\\'s sound and played a part in the lasting chart success of the album, as audiophiles constantly replaced their worn-out copies. [31] After the success of Dark Side, the band were unsure of their future direction and worried about how they would be able to top that record\\'s huge popularity. In a return to their experimental beginnings, they began work on a project entitled Household Objects, which would consist of songs played literally on household appliances. Instruments consisted of old hand mixers, rubber bands stretched between two tables, wine glasses, etc. However, the planned album was soon shelved after the band decided that it was just easier and better to play the songs on actual musical instruments. No finished recordings of these sessions exist, however some of the recorded effects were put to use on their next album. Wish You Were Here (album), released in 1975, carries an abstract theme of absence: absence of any humanity within the music industry and, most poignantly, the absence of Syd Barrett. Well-known for its popular title track, the album includes the largely instrumental, nine-part song suite \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\" a tribute to Barrett in which the lyrics deal explicitly with the aftermath of his breakdown. Many of the musical influences in the band\\'s past were brought together—atmospheric keyboards, blues guitar pieces, extended saxophone solos (by Dick Parry), jazz-fusion workouts and aggressive slide guitar—in the suite\\'s different linked parts, culminating in a funeral dirge played with synthesized horn and ending with a musical quote from their early single \"See Emily Play\" as a final nod to Barrett\\'s early leadership of the band. [33] The remaining tracks on the album, \"Welcome to the Machine\" and \"Have a Cigar,\" harshly criticize the music industry; the latter is sung by British folk singer Roy Harper. It was the first Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and the U.S. charts, [34] and critics praise it just as enthusiastically as The Dark Side of the Moon. Roger Waters – led era: 1976–1985 During this era, Waters asserted more and more control over Pink Floyd\\'s output. During the recording, Waters fired Richard Wright after The Wall was finished, arguing that Wright was not contributing much, [35] in part due to a cocaine addiction . [36] Waters claimed that David Gilmour and Nick Mason supported Waters\\' decision to fire Wright, but in 2000, Gilmour stated that he and Mason were against Wright\\'s dismissal. [37] Author Nick Mason claims that Wright was fired because Columbia Records had offered Waters a substantial bonus to finish the album in time for a 1979 release. Since Wright refused to return early from his summer holiday, Waters wanted to dismiss Wright. [38] Wright was fired from the band but stayed on to finish the album and perform the live concerts as a paid musician. Much of the music from this period is considered secondary to the lyrics, which explore Waters\\' feelings about his father\\'s death in World War II and his increasingly cynical attitude towards political figures such as Margaret Thatcher and Mary Whitehouse. Although still finely nuanced, the music grew more guitar-based at the expense of keyboards and saxophone, both of which became (at best) part of the music\\'s background texture along with the usual sound effects. A full orchestra (even larger than the brass ensemble from Atom Heart Mother ) plays a significant role on The Wall and especially The Final Cut. By January 1977, and the release of Animals (UK #2, U.S. #3), the band\\'s music came under increasing criticism from some quarters in the new punk rock sphere as being too flabby and pretentious, having lost its way from the simplicity of early rock and roll. [39] Animals was, however, considerably more guitar-driven than the previous albums, due to either the influence of the burgeoning punk-rock movement or the fact that the album was recorded at Pink Floyd\\'s new (and somewhat incomplete) Britannia Row Studios. The album was also the first to not have a single songwriting credit for Rick Wright. Animals again contained lengthy songs tied to a theme, this time taken in part from George Orwell \\'s Animal Farm, which used \"Pigs,\" \"Dogs\" and \"Sheep\" as metaphors for members of contemporary society. Despite the prominence of guitar, keyboards and synthesizers still play an important role on Animals , but the saxophone and female vocal work that defined much of the previous two albums\\' sound is absent. The result is a more hard-rock effort overall, bookended by two parts of a quiet acoustic piece. Many critics did not respond well to the album, finding it \"tedious\" and \"bleak,\" [40] although some celebrated it for almost those very reasons. For the cover artwork, a giant inflatable pig was commissioned to float between the chimney towers of London\\'s Battersea Power Station. The pig became one of the enduring symbols of Pink Floyd, and inflatable pigs were a staple of Pink Floyd live performances from then on. In 1978 the band were told that due to legal matters involving tax, they had to leave the United Kingdom for one year, with absolutely no visits in between. It was during this time that the band started to pursue their own interests and focus less on music, and so when they re-met in the UK, they were short of ideas. It came to light that Waters had been working on two projects, \"The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking\" and The Wall. 1979\\'s epic rock opera The Wall, conceived by Waters, dealt with the themes of loneliness and failed communication, which were expressed by the metaphor of a wall built between a rock artist and his audience. The deciding moment in which to conceive The Wall was during a concert in Montreal, Canada in which Roger Waters spat at an audience member who had been shouting unhelpful comments and requesting songs throughout the show. It was this point where Waters felt the alienation between audience and band. This album gave Pink Floyd renewed acclaim and their only chart-topping single with \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\". [17] The Wall also included the future concert staples \"Comfortably Numb\" and \"Run Like Hell,\" with the former in particular becoming a cornerstone of album-oriented rock and classic-rock radio playlists as well as one of the group\\'s best-known songs. The teacher puppet used in the concert The album was co-produced by Bob Ezrin, a friend of Waters who shared songwriting credits on \"The Trial\" and from whom Waters later distanced himself after Ezrin \"shot his mouth off to the press.\" [41] Even more than during the Animals sessions, Waters was asserting his artistic influence and leadership over the band, using the band\\'s perilous financial situation to his advantage, which prompted increased conflicts with the other members. The music had become distinctly more hard-rock, although the large orchestrations on some tracks recalled an earlier period, and there are a few quieter songs interspersed throughout (such as \"Goodbye Blue Sky,\" \"Nobody Home,\" and \"Vera (song)\"). Wright\\'s influence was minimized, and he was fired from the band during recording, only returning on a fixed wage for the live shows in support of the album. Ironically, this fixed salary made Wright the only \"member\" of Pink Floyd to make any money from the Wall concerts, with the three remaining members stuck covering the extensive cost overruns of their most spectacular concerts yet. [42] The Wall was performed live in only a few cities, contributing to the \"tour\"\\'s unprofitability. (It would be performed one more time, after the Berlin Wall came down in Germany, by Roger Waters and others). Despite never hitting #1 in the UK (it reached #3), The Wall spent 15 weeks atop the U.S. charts in 1980. [19] Critics praised it, [43] and it has been certified 23x platinum by the RIAA, for sales of 11.5 million copies of the double album in the U.S. alone. The huge commercial success of The Wall made Pink Floyd the only artists since the Beatles to have the best-selling albums of two years (1973 and 1980) in less than a decade. A film entitled Pink Floyd: The Wall was released in 1982, incorporating almost all of the music from the album. The film, written by Waters and directed by Alan Parker, starred Boomtown Rats founder Bob Geldof, who re-recorded many of the vocals, and featured animation by noted British artist and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe. Film critic Leonard Maltin referred to the movie as \"the world\\'s longest rock video, and certainly the most depressing,\" but it grossed over US$14 million at the North American box office. Their 1983 studio album, The Final Cut, was dedicated by Waters to his father, Eric Fletcher Waters. Even darker in tone than The Wall, this album re-examined many previous themes, while also addressing then-current events, including Waters\\' anger at Britain\\'s participation in the Falklands War , the blame for which he laid squarely at the feet of political leaders (\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\"). It concludes with a cynical and frightening glimpse at the possibility of nuclear war (\"Two Suns in the Sunset\"). Michael Kamen and Andy Bown contributed keyboard work in lieu of Richard Wright, whose departure had not been formally announced before the album\\'s release. The music\\'s tone is largely similar to The Wall\\' s but somewhat quieter and softer, resembling songs like \"Nobody Home\" more than \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2).\" It is also more repetitive, with certain leitmotifs cropping up continually. Only moderately successful with fans by Floyd\\'s standards (UK #1, U.S. #6), [19] but reasonably well-received by critics, [44] the album yielded one minor radio hit (albeit in bowdlerised form), \"Not Now John,\" the only hard-rock song on the album (and the only one partially sung by Gilmour). The arguments between Waters and Gilmour at this stage were rumored to be so bad that they were supposedly never seen in the recording studio simultaneously. Gilmour has said he wanted to continue making good quality rock music, and felt Waters was constructing music sequences together merely as a vehicle for his socially critical lyrics. Waters claims that his bandmates never fully understood the importance of the social commentary he was making. By the end of recording, Gilmour\\'s co-producer credit was dropped from the album sleeve (though he received attendant royalties). [45] There was no tour for the album, although parts of it have since been performed live by Waters on his subsequent solo tours. After The Final Cut Capitol Records released the compilation Works , which made the 1970 Waters track \"Embryo\" available for the first time on a Pink Floyd album, although the track had been released on the 1970 VA compilation Picnic - A Breath of Fresh Air on the Harvest Records label. [46] The band members then went their separate ways and spent time working on individual projects. Gilmour was the first to release his solo album About Face in March 1984. Wright joined forces with Dave Harris of Fashion to form a new band, Zee, which released the experimental album Identity a month after Gilmour\\'s project. In May 1984, Waters released The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, a concept album once proposed as a Pink Floyd project. A year after his bandmates\\' projects, Mason released the album Profiles, a collaboration with Rick Fenn of 10cc which featured guest appearances by Gilmour and UFO keyboardist Danny Peyronel. David Gilmour – led era: 1987–1995 Waters announced in December 1985 that he was departing Pink Floyd, describing the band as \"a spent force,\" but in 1986 Gilmour and Mason began recording a new Pink Floyd album. At the same time, Roger Waters was working on his second solo album, entitled Radio K.A.O.S. (1987). A bitter legal dispute ensued with Waters claiming that the name \"Pink Floyd\" should have been put to rest, but Gilmour and Mason upheld their conviction that they had the legal right to continue as \"Pink Floyd.\" The suit was eventually settled out of court. [47] After considering and rejecting many other titles, the new album was released as A Momentary Lapse of Reason (UK #3, U.S. #3). Without Waters, who had been the band\\'s dominant songwriter for a decade, the band sought the help of outside writers. As Pink Floyd had never done this before (except for the orchestral contributions of Geesin and Ezrin), this move received much criticism. Ezrin, who had renewed his friendship with Gilmour in 1983 (as Ezrin co-produced Gilmour\\'s About Face album), served as co-producer as well as writer along with Jon Carin] who wrote the music for \"Learning To Fly\" and played much of the Keyboards on the album. [48] Wright also returned, at first as a salaried employee during the final recording sessions, and then officially rejoining the band after the subsequent tour. Gilmour later admitted that Mason and Wright had hardly played on the album. Because of Mason and Wright\\'s limited contributions, some critics say that A Momentary Lapse of Reason should really be regarded as a Gilmour solo effort, in much the same way that The Final Cut might be regarded as a Waters album. A year later, the band released a double live album and a concert video taken from its 1988 Long Island shows, entitled Delicate Sound of Thunder, and later recorded some instrumentals for a classic-car racing film La Carrera Panamericana, set in Mexico and featuring Gilmour and Mason as participating drivers. During the race Gilmour and manager Steve O\\'Rourke (acting as his map-reader) crashed. O\\'Rourke suffered a broken leg, but Gilmour walked away with just some bruises. David Gilmour in a break during the \"Carrera Panamericana,\" in San Luis Potosi, Mexico The instrumentals are notable for including the first Floyd material co-written by Wright since 1975, as well as the only Floyd material co-written by Mason since Dark Side of the Moon. The band\\'s next recording was the 1994 release, The Division Bell, which was much more of a group effort than Momentary Lapse had been, with Wright now reinstated as a full band member. The album was received more favorably by critics and fans alike than Lapse had been, [49] but was still heavily criticized as tired and formulaic. It was the second Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and U.S. charts. The Division Bell was another concept album, in some ways representing Gilmour\\'s take on the same themes Waters had tackled with The Wall. The title was suggested to Gilmour by his friend Douglas Adams. Many of the lyrics were co-written by Polly Samson, Gilmour\\'s girlfriend at the time, whom he married shortly after the album\\'s release. Besides Samson, the album featured most of the musicians who had joined the A Momentary Lapse of Reason tour, as well as saxophonist Dick Parry, a contributor to the mid-70s Floyd albums. Anthony Moore, who had co-written the lyrics for several songs on the previous album, wrote lyrics for Wright\\'s tune \"Wearing the Inside Out,\" also Wright\\'s first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd record since Dark Side of the Moon . This writing collaboration continued on Wright\\'s 1996 solo album, Broken China. The band released a live album entitled P*U*L*S*E in 1995. It hit #1 in U.S. and featured songs recorded during the \"Division Bell\" tour, primarily from concerts in Londons Earl Court. The Division Bell concerts featured a mix of classic and modern Pink Floyd. The Pulse album has an entire performance of The Dark Side of the Moon. VHS and Laserdisc versions of the concert at London\\'s Earl\\'s Court 20 October 1994, were also released. A P*U*L*S*E (film) DVD edition was released July 2006. and quickly topped the charts. The 1994 CD case had an LED , timer IC , and battery which caused a red flash to blink once per second, like a heartbeat, as it sat in the owner\\'s CD collection. In 1995 the band received their first and only Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for \"Marooned.\" 1995–present On January 17, 1996, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame [50] by The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan. Still antagonistic towards his former bandmates, Roger Waters did not attend. At their acceptance speech, Gilmour said, \"I\\'ll have to grab a couple more of these for our two band members that started playing different tunes; Roger and Syd….\" Although Mason was present to accept the award, he did not join Gilmour and Wright (and Billy Corgan) for their acoustic performance of \\'Wish You Were Here\\'. Long-time Pink Floyd manager Steve O\\'Rourke died on October 30, 2003. Gilmour, Mason and Wright reunited at his funeral and performed \"Fat Old Sun\" and \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" in Chichester Cathedral in tribute. [51] Two years later, on July 2, 2005, the band reunited once again for a one-off performance at the London Live 8 concert. This time, however, they were joined by Waters–the first time all four band members were on stage together in 24 years. The band performed a four-song set consisting of \"Speak to Me/Breathe,\" \"Money,\" \"Wish You Were Here,\" and \"Comfortably Numb,\" with both Gilmour and Waters sharing lead vocals. At the end of their performance Gilmour said \"thank you very much, good night\" and started to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, however, and the band shared a group hug that became one of the most famous images of Live 8. In the week after Live 8, there was a revival of interest in Pink Floyd. According to record store chain HMV, sales of Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd went up, in the following week, by 1343 percent, while Amazon.com reported increases in sales of The Wall at 3600 percent, Wish You Were Here at 2000 percent, The Dark Side of the Moon at 1400 percent and Animals at 1000 percent. David Gilmour subsequently declared that he would donate his share of profits from this sales boom to charity, [52] and urged all the other artists and record companies profiting from Live 8 to do the same. On November 16, 2005 Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend. Gilmour and Mason attended in person, explaining that Wright was in hospital following eye surgery, and Waters appeared on a video screen, from Rome . Live performances Pink Floyd are renowned for their lavish stage shows, combining over-the-top visual experiences with music to create a show in which the performers themselves are almost secondary. They have always resisted the temptation of a large screen portraying band members because they \"don\\'t really do very much,\" preferring instead to show music videos to run alongside the songs. Influences on other musicians Pink Floyd have influenced progressive rock artists of the 1970s such as Genesis and Yes; [53] and various contemporary artists such as Dream Theater, Tool, Porcupine Tree, Anathema and Nine Inch Nails. Their music plays a featured role in the Tom Stoppard play Rock \\'n\\' Roll.

I received a lot of different replies. I am posting a summary, with a few corrections, of the list that was most complete.  (Thank-you Carl Johnson and Scott Bodarky). Most people erred in identifying the singer(s) on the earlier (pre-WALL) albums.  Most people agreed that Roger Waters has a voice which is more \"whiny\" and David Gilmour has a voice which is more \"lovely\".  However, this whiny quality in Roger\\'s voice seems to be particular to _The Wall_. He did a lot of singing on earlier albums before this quality of his voice became so noticeable. I heard a David Gilmour interview on a late-night interview a couple of weeks ago.  In this interview he described Roger\\'s voice as \"venomous\".  I like this description.  Also, the songs that David Gilmour is credited with co-writing on the Wall, or Dark Side of the Moon, or Wish You Were Here, are all MUSICAL contributions, not lyrical contributions.  In the same interview, David mentioned that he prefers a \"fuller more orchestral sound\", and Roger prefers \"a minimalist sound\".   He said that one of the reasons the release of _Dark Side of the Moon_ was delayed was because of a complete disagreement on how the songs on that album should be mixed. I think this is one of the reasons the \"Gilmour songs\" get more radio air play.  They sound more \"poppy\" than Roger\\'s songs.  That isn\\'t to say \"poppy\" is bad, just more main-stream. Also, several people asked why I didn\\'t include all the PF albums for analysis.  I guess I just figured people wouldn\\'t have heard of a lot of the earlier albums, or that they wouldn\\'t be sufficiently interested.  It seems I was wrong.  Two albums that people specifically commented on were _Piper_ and _The Final Cut_.  I include these below too. Colleen ------------------------------------------------------------------------- PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN All, or at least a morjority of the songs here are sung by Syd Barrett; Barrett left the band after this album because of drug problems. >DARK SIDE OF THE MOON >  Breathe in the Air D.

Waters sings this in its entirety (except for the Run...Run...Run... bits). There are alternating vocal lines, but they are Waters overdubbed on himself.  If you listen to Gilmour\\'s hapless attempts to perform this song on his more recent material, this will be clear. I know that there is at least one person out there who is insistent that Gilmour sings some of this material.  I am insistent that Waters sings the whole thing.  Let\\'s not argue about it further, please. >   The Trial >     R. Waters (yes, all parts; Pink\\'s judging himself, after all) >     Bob Ezrin (The Judge at the trial, though I like the >     explanation above better.) Waters sings the whole song.  There is a large cadre of singers who are credited on the album--Ezrin is not one of them.  As on earlier albums, tape manipulation was used to effect the part of the judge. Richard Wright sings backup on most of the songs on which Gilmour sings lead.  The 50\\'s doo-wop stuff is done by the three singers plus the backup singers who are credited as such. -- -Scott Bodarky\\t\\t  | \"You can\\'t run a race with a book of religion, bod...@cme.nist.gov |  Not with a heap, or a lump, or a smidgeon, |  Of foolish rules of ancient date, |  Designed to make you all feel great, The National Institute of |  While you fold, spindle, and mutilate, Standards and Technology  |  Those unbelievers from a neighboring state.\"  -FZ Steve Anderson unread, Jun 1, 1990, 4:27:26\\u202fPM 6/1/90 \\ue83a \\ue5d4 Delete You do not have permission to delete messages in this group Copy link Report message Sign in to report message Show original message Either email addresses are anonymous for this group or you need the view member email addresses permission to view the original message to All the arguing over who sang what songs on The Wall is very interesting, but lets move on to more important issues: Which song(s) on \"The Wall\" did Toni Tenille (sp?, she of \"Muskrat Love\") sing on? --steve -- H.

I don\\'t want to argue pointlessly either, nor with a fellow Floydian.  So consider this good-natured commentary on your corrections.  I do have a good stereo, multi-media versions of each album, many live bootlegs.  And I have listened to Pink Floyd enough to discern the respective singers.  I was able to do that whole list from memory, after all.  Still, the record (ignore any possible puns) could stand some more commentary, apparently. >> WISH YOU WERE HERE >>   Welcome to the Machine >>     D. Gilmour (Waters is mixed lower but is there too) >Ach.  Roger Waters sings this.  He has commented in the past that >they had to do some tape manipulation because part of the vocal >was out of his range. And Gilmour is present too.  I listed him first, since Roger\\'s voice is not as prominent in the mix.  The old tape manipulation factoid caused me to mention Waters at all, but he\\'s certainly not singing alone.  Listen to the track, and Dave is foremost.  After that, listen to some bootlegs, and you\\'ll hear them both sing (and Roger does come out more in those mixes). Should I have simply said they both sang it and been done with it?  Probably so, but Gilmour\\'s voice was so much more discernable, and I thought that was the essential point of asking about who sings which. Here\\'s our only disagreement: >> THE WALL >>   Run Like Hell >>     D. Gilmour \"You better make your face up with your favorite disguise\" >>     R. Waters \"With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes\" >>     D. Gilmour \"With your empty smile and your hungry heart\" >>     R. Waters \"Feel the bile rising from your guilty past\" >>     ...alternates till end. >Waters sings this in its entirety (except for the Run...Run...Run... bits). >There are alternating vocal lines, but they are Waters overdubbed on >himself. Talk about learning how to distinguish their voices.  This is a difficult track to do so, and I didn\\'t get it for a long while either.  I thought the same individual sang both parts, but then I got the seed from Gilmour\\'s tours.  During the About Face tour, it was obvious that Dave tried not to sing any of the lyrics Roger sang originally, and had other\\'s take over for Roger\\'s parts, much to the dismay of Comfortably Numb fans (Dave did sing for \\'Another Brick...\\' though).  With Roger\\'s Pros and Cons tour, it was apparent Roger was observing the same \\'rule,\\' also mangling Money in the process. Anyways, back to the story.  Relistening then to The Wall album, the separate voices on Run Like Hell became readily apparent.  Somehow, I wasn\\'t the only one who came to that conclusion either, since at least two others have posted saying the same thing.  It\\'s easier to believe that the difference between the parts is simply not very noticeable, then to believe that several of us are imagining a difference, and the exact same one, with Dave odd\\'s and Roger even\\'s, where there is none.  The record is more straight if we conclude both sang, then if one did. One more thing:  Scott would be correct if we were considering the version from the movie.  There Roger definitely redubbed the song so that his voice sang both parts, and it\\'s almost too obvious, since the levels are clearly different.  Not only is the alternating volume levels on the lyrics annoying, but that he combined the synth solo with the second verse, making the song much shorter, ruined that track, in my opinion.  But, to the point, why would Roger redub the song if he sang both parts originally? >I am insistent that Waters sings the whole thing.  Let\\'s not argue about it >further, please. Well, you still haven\\'t listened to it again, so please give it a try.  With the idea in mind, the distinctive voices might be more apparent to you. Next, a half-disagreement: >>   The Trial >>     R. Waters (yes, all parts; Pink\\'s judging himself, after all) >>     Bob Ezrin (The Judge at the trial, though I like the >>     explanation above better.) >Waters sings the whole song. That\\'s what I thought too, since it fits with the theme better, as I said, and we may both be correct.  Still, the tape effects explanation doesn\\'t explain why Roger didn\\'t sing the Judge part live, as he has other bits where he had manipulated tape.  Don\\'t know who it is myself, but I would say it was Roger on the album anyways.  Someone else did claim it was Bob Ezrin, though, and that jived too well with the concert evidence.  Maybe Michael Kamen? >Richard Wright sings backup on most of the songs on which Gilmour >sings lead.

This was discussed in earnest on the Pink Floyd mailing list a few months ago... If I remember correctly, the band handed out cards with questions on them to people hanging around the studio (janitors, etc...).

There was the 1984 tour with Eric Clapton and the 1985 tour where Waters hit the road without Clapton, Tim Renwick, and Chris Stainton (replacing them with Jay Stapely and Andy Fairweather-Low).   I saw both tours. The 1984 version was about a hundred times better!!!! (he only played 4 US cities - Hartford, E. Rutherford_NJ(NYC), Philly, and Rosemont_Ill(Chicago) - and only two other N.

Three tracks; the title is the original album version.  \"Money\" is indeed live with Mr. Carrack on vocals; even has a cute \"Lear jet\" sound rush across the stage (leave it to Roger to overstate his point with sound effects :-). The last track (final cut?) is a demo, \"Get Back to Radio\", sounding like an outtake from The Final Cut or Pros and Cons; lots of whiny sax, plenty of vocal double tracking (one mumbling, one screeching, as usual :-).  Supposedly the inspiration for KAOS, although it sounds not a bit like the album ... I doubt the single is widely available these days; I bought mine two years ago and it was getting tough to find then -- import to US from UK, cost about US$14.  I believe the only other single was for \"Radio Waves\", which contained a remix at least; I don\\'t know what else was on it.  I passed it up once and have kicked myself since.

Skip to Content Search Magnifying Glass Search for: Close Search × Interviews Electronic Dance Music (EDM) Rock / Pop Country / Jazz Hip Hop Playlists Music Media Insights Streaming Media Cast Film News Net Worth Movies About Us Contributors Contact Cadences of Comeback: The Music Industry’s Rebound From Covid Era The global pandemic upended industries far and wide, with the music sector among the hardest hit. Venues shuttered, tours were canceled, and artists found themselves confined to their homes, separated from their audiences and each other. Yet, amidst this silence, the music industry orchestrated a remarkable rebound, a testament to its resilience, innovation, and the unyielding human spirit’s desire for connection through music. This article explores the cadences of comeback that have defined the music industry’s response to the challenges of the Covid era, showcasing how adversity led to innovation, solidarity, and a renewed appreciation for the power of music. The Silence Before the Symphony The initial impact of Covid-19 on the music industry was both immediate and devastating. Live music, the lifeblood of the industry, came to an abrupt halt, with major festivals and tours canceled or postponed indefinitely. The ripple effects were felt across the ecosystem, from artists and live event workers to venues and surrounding businesses. The silence was deafening, both metaphorically and literally, as cities known for their vibrant music scenes fell quiet. Digital Interlude: The Rise of Virtual Concerts and Streaming However, silence soon gave way to a digital crescendo. Artists and organizations quickly pivoted to virtual platforms, turning living rooms into stages and screens into arenas. Virtual concerts, live-streamed performances, and digital festivals became the new norm, offering fans a semblance of the live music experience from the safety of their homes. This period saw innovative uses of technology, with platforms like Zoom, Instagram Live, and Twitch becoming the venues of choice for artists ranging from bedroom musicians to global superstars. Streaming platforms also played a crucial role during this time, experiencing significant growth. With people spending more time at home, consumption of recorded music surged. Artists released new work, engaging with their audiences through social media and other digital channels, fostering a sense of community and continuity in a time of isolation. Harmonizing Health and Safety: The Return of Live Music As the world began to adapt to the new normal, the music industry started exploring ways to safely bring live music back. This led to the emergence of socially distanced concerts, drive-in shows, and reduced-capacity events, each adhering to strict health and safety protocols. These events were a lifeline for artists and fans alike, offering a glimpse of hope and a reminder of the communal power of live music. See also What Is The Song Fast Car About Venues and event organizers became adept at navigating the complexities of the pandemic, investing in health and safety measures, and leveraging technology to create safer environments. Contactless ticketing, timed entries, and improved ventilation systems became standard, demonstrating the industry’s commitment to safety without sacrificing the essence of live music. Synchronizing Sustainability and Innovation The pandemic also accelerated discussions around sustainability and the future of the music industry. The forced pause provided an opportunity for reflection and reevaluation, leading to initiatives aimed at reducing the environmental impact of touring and promoting more sustainable practices within the industry. Innovation flourished in other areas as well. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) concerts began to gain traction, offering immersive experiences that transcended geographical limitations. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) emerged as a new way for artists to monetize their work and engage with fans, opening up discussions about the value of digital art and ownership. Crescendo of Community and Support Perhaps one of the most heartening aspects of the music industry’s rebound has been the strengthened sense of community and support among its members. Initiatives to support struggling artists, crew members, and venues sprang up around the globe. From artist relief funds to campaigns aimed at saving independent venues, the industry banded together to weather the storm. This period also saw artists collaborating in new and creative ways, bridging distances through technology. These collaborations not only resulted in unique musical works but also highlighted the unifying power of music, serving as a beacon of hope and solidarity in challenging times. The Ongoing Symphony: Challenges and Opportunities Ahead As the world continues to navigate the aftermath of the pandemic, the music industry faces ongoing challenges and uncertainties. However, the resilience, adaptability, and creativity demonstrated over the past years provide a strong foundation for the future. The lessons learned during the pandemic are shaping the industry’s evolution, with a greater emphasis on digital innovation, sustainability, and community. As live music makes its triumphant return, the industry is also mindful of the need to balance the excitement of revival with the realities of an ever-changing world.

From the depths of silence emerged a symphony of resilience, innovation, and community, highlighting the enduring power of music to inspire, unite, and heal. As we look to the future, the music industry’s journey through the pandemic serves as a powerful reminder of its capacity to adapt and thrive in the face of adversity. The music plays on, a testament to the industry’s resilience and the universal language of music that continues to bring us together, no matter the challenges we face. The Covid-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges for artists worldwide, but it also presented unique opportunities for creativity, innovation, and connection. Amidst the turmoil, several artists not only endured but also found ways to thrive, reaching new heights of fame and influence. Here are 11 artists who made a significant impact and got famous during the Covid era: Dua Lipa – With the release of her disco-inspired album “Future Nostalgia” just as the world went into lockdown, Dua Lipa became the soundtrack to many people’s pandemic experience.

This new edition of the album will feature the prism spectrum seen through the playable \\n\\t\\tside of the vinyl whilst maintaining the best quality sound that fans will expect. It will be packaged in a slipcased gatefold sleeve, with \\n\\t\\tan exclusive poster. This is the first time that Pink Floyd have used this pioneering UV printing process on vinyl. The images are printed with a high-end UV printer, \\n\\t\\tusing UV-Led light to dry the permanent ink on the side without audio on which the image is printed. This combination of one-sided audio and the \\n\\t\\tUV print (on the side without audio) combines the best of both worlds: perfect audio and a beautiful image to enjoy. The set is available to pre-order here and follows the 2023 release of the remastered album on CD, LP and Blu-ray, first available as part of \\n\\t\\tThe Dark Side Of The Moon 50th Anniversary Box Set. 23 January 2024 26 October 2023 Pink Floyd\\'s Atom Heart Mother will be released as a special 2-disc package in a 7-inch gatefold sleeve, containing the Atom Heart Mother album on \\n\\t\\tCD and a Blu-ray disc featuring footage of Atom Heart Mother (Suite) performed at Hakone Aphrodite Festival, Japan in August 1971 – originally released \\n\\t\\tas part of The Early Years box set. The film has been upgraded from a recently discovered original tape of the time. It also includes a behind the scenes \\n\\t\\tmini documentary. It will be released on Friday 8th December and available to pre-order here . Originally only released in Japan in 2021, the set contains some unique memorabilia – a special photo book containing many rare, never-seen-before \\n\\t\\tphotos, reproductions of the pamphlet, the poster, the concert ticket, and the flier distributed at the event. The only Pink Floyd footage at Hakone Aphrodite that exists is that of the 16-minute-long suite Atom Heart Mother . The details including whereabouts \\n\\t\\tof the master film and how it was shot had been a mystery for a long time. However, after fifty years, the original 16mm film of this video was \\n\\t\\tdiscovered in a fan\\'s garage. The meticulous processes of digitizing, restoring and remastering was undertaken and finally this enhanced video will be \\n\\t\\treleased outside of Japan. Over 50 years ago, Japan\\'s first international outdoor rock festival \"Hakone Aphrodite\" was held at a specially built venue beside Hakone Ashinoko Lake \\n\\t\\ton August 6th and 7th, 1971. Pink Floyd\\'s first-ever concert in Japan was as headliner for the festival . Aspiring to be the Japanese Woodstock, \\n\\t\\tThe \"Hakone Aphrodite\" invited many international artists and became the first rock festival experience for many Japanese fans. The set contains not only the original live footage (with audio taken from the gig at Hakone Aphrodite), but also behind-the-scenes footage of the band, \\n\\t\\ttravelling between the airport, the hotel, the press conference, the bullet train, the show set-up, and, of course, beautiful Japanese scenery. At the time of the historic concert, Pink Floyd had just released Atom Heart Mother (in October 1970), and were yet to release Meddle (released in \\n\\t\\tNovember 1971). Pink Floyd appeared as the final act of the festival, and alongside Atom Heart Mother , they performed another five songs \\n\\t\\tincluding Careful With That Axe, Eugene , A Saucerful Of Secrets , and Echoes from then-unreleased album Meddle . Sadly, official footage \\n\\t\\tof these has not resurfaced. The band\\'s mystical and fantastic show, enhanced by nature\\'s unwitting stage effects of fog emerging from the lake when \\n\\t\\tthey played, was talked about for years to come. For the show, Pink Floyd used huge PA systems not yet commonly used in Japan back then, and it is \\n\\t\\twidely believed that this show greatly influenced Japanese audio and stage production after that. Pink Floyd Atom Heart Mother – Special Edition is available to pre-order here . 9 October 2023 Pink Floyd continue to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the classic album THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON by releasing a brand new 30-minute film \\n\\t\\tdocumenting the recent Australian eclipse. Entitled Eclipse , it follows a number of lucky Pink Floyd fans, The Astronome Domine Eight, who were \\n\\t\\tgiven the exclusive opportunity to visit the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Ningaloo Marine Park in Exmouth, Western Australia, and listen to The \\n\\t\\tDark Side Of The Moon on headphones alongside a purpose-built pyramid on a deserted beach, whilst witnessing a once-in-a-lifetime viewing of an \\n\\t\\textraordinary and rare total solar eclipse phenomenon. The documentary, created by the group\\'s long-time Creative Consultant and Hipgnosis co-founder, Aubrey \\'Po\\' Powell and his team, Director Benny Trickett \\n\\t\\tand Producer Fiz Oliver, traces the Astronome Domine Eight\\'s journey from applying for the trip through to their emotional feelings afterwards. Locals \\n\\t\\tin the area and thousands of others who had also made the historic trip to Exmouth to be part of the experience were also interviewed as part of the \\n\\t\\tdocumentary.

Pre-order here . 8 July 2023 THE SOLO WORKS OF SYD BARRETT \"Well, that\\'s the last we\\'ll ever hear of Pink Floyd.\" With his presence looming so large over the band, it\\'s not hard to believe the apocryphal quote that Pink Floyd was genuinely considered \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twithout a future upon the 1968 exit of cofounder and primary songwriter Syd Barrett. Barrett led the legendary band and helped steer the surrounding scene out of the limiting constraints of its blues-based R&B roots and \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfull speed into the expanse of the lysergic late 1960s. Yet his subsequent solo work, in the shadow of Floyd\\'s impending world-spanning \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tomnipresence, exists as a quixotic, mythical output that\\'s equally confounding and delightful, earning a cult following of adventurous \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tears over the ensuing fifty years. While Syd Barrett may not be the first nor the most successful to dive into the convergence of the psychedelic and folk realms, he is, \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twithout question, the quintessential archetype from which all others must be compared. His influence and reach cannot be overstated. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBarrett\\'s overexaggerated reputation for experimentation with hallucinogenic drugs tends to propagate the mystique behind his art, but do \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnot mistake that for importance. The music speaks for itself. Syd Barrett\\'s body of work is of the highest caliber. Individually out of print on LP for almost ten years and NEVER previously available together on vinyl, Third Man Records in conjunction \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twith Sony Music Entertainment is humbled to present Syd Barrett\\'s solo albums – The Madcap Laughs , Barrett , and Opel – as the \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t57th installment of the Vault subscription series. Originally released in January 1970, The Madcap Laughs serves as Barrett\\'s best-known and most fully-realized solo effort. Standout tracks \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlike the debut single Octopus charm with whimsy and consciousness-expanding lyrical exploration. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(then known as EMI Recording Studios) with production help from former Floyd bandmates David Gilmour and Roger Waters, the album \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsurprisingly reached number 40 on the UK charts. The reissue is pressed lovingly on golden hair colored vinyl. Released in November of 1970, Barrett again enlisted former bandmates\\' production guidance (Gilmour again in addition to Richard Wright) \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tat Abbey Road Studios. Featuring surreal gems like Baby Lemonade and the explorative Gigolo Aunt the album compels with a softly \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfocused hazy introspection. Here it is presented on baby lemonade colored vinyl. Consisting of outtakes and previously unreleased material from the 1968-1970 era, 1988\\'s Opel fills in the blanks of the two previous \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\talbums. Properly illuminating the full picture of Barrett\\'s studio work, where no two takes were ever the same, the significance of Opel is two-fold. First, as an early example of a record label reacting to an underground, cult following. At that time it was almost odd for \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tan imprint to dig into the vault. But with Syd being held in such high regard and interest in his work unflagging, countless illicit \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbootlegs would be rendered obsolete by the depths dug on Opel . For these purposes it is offered on milky way opal colored vinyl. All three LPs are pressed on 180-gram vinyl at Third Man Pressing in Detroit and will come housed in a newly-designed slipcase featuring \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta recursive portrait of Syd by New York Times bestselling author and illustrator Greg Ruth. Executed in one continuous line without \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlifting the pen, the image is hypnotizing, mesmerizing and easy to get lost in, just like Barrett\\'s music. An added bonus to this collection is a 7-inch single by David Gilmour covering two Barrett compositions. Dominoes was recorded at Royal \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFestival Hall in January 2002 and plucks an undeniable playful jaunt, decidedly ebullient and fresh. The take on Dark Globe was recorded \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlive, shortly after Syd\\'s death in 2006. Celebratory, heartfelt, joyous and sad all at once, the rendition here is sparse \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand unfiltered. If you can look past all the lore and history and mythos...it is simply an earnest tribute to a departed friend. Order by midnight local time Monday 31st July to guarantee yourself a copy of this essential collection. Only available at www.thirdmanrecords.com/vault .

So here it is, with a newly edited video taken from a Pulse rehearsal during Pink Floyd\\'s two-week run at Earl\\'s Court, London, in 1994. The recording, \\n\\t\\tusing the original drums and bass by Nick and David, has keyboards by Rick and backing vocals by Claudia, Sam and Durga taken from the Pulse rehearsals. \\n\\t\\tNew piano, Prophet 5 synthesiser and Hammond are played by David, as on the original demo. 18 July 2022 A TWEET FROM ClientEarth BREAKING: We won our case against the UK gov\\'s inadequate net zero strategy! On the hottest day on record in the UK, the High Court has ruled that the government\\'s Net Zero Strategy breaches the Climate Change Act. This is a landmark victory. 30 June 2022 PINK FLOYD\\'S \\'ANIMALS 2018 REMIX\\' Warner Music [Sony Music outside Europe] today announced the upcoming release of Pink Floyd\\'s \\'Animals\\' on Deluxe Gatefold, CD, LP, Blu-ray and \\n\\t\\tSACD. The individual versions will be available on 16 September 2022 with the Deluxe version available from 7 October . This is the first \\n\\t\\ttime the album will have been available on 5.1 Surround Sound. Animals is the tenth studio album by Pink Floyd, originally released in January 1977. It was recorded at the band\\'s Britannia Row Studios in \\n\\t\\tLondon throughout 1976 and early 1977, and was produced by the band themselves. The successful album peaked at number 2 in the UK and number 3 in the \\n\\t\\tUS, and is considered as one of the band\\'s best works. The album was recorded by band members David Gilmour, Nick Mason, Roger Waters and Richard Wright. Animals 2018 Remix will be released on CD, LP (with gatefold artwork), Blu-ray, SACD and Deluxe Gatefold formats. The Deluxe Gatefold version \\n\\t\\tincludes LP, CD, audio Blu-ray, audio DVD and a 32-page book. The Blu-ray and DVD audio include the 2018 remix in Stereo, 5.1 Surround (both by James \\n\\t\\tGuthrie) and the original 1977 Stereo mix. The 32-page booklet features rarely seen behind the scenes photographs of the album sleeve shoot along with \\n\\t\\tlive images and memorabilia. The album artwork has been reimagined for this release. Animals is a concept album, focusing on the social-political conditions of mid-1970s Britain, and was a change from the style of the band\\'s \\n\\t\\tearlier work. The album was developed from a collection of unrelated songs into a concept which describes the apparent social and moral decay of society, \\n\\t\\tlikening the human condition to that of animals. Taking inspiration from George Orwell\\'s Animal Farm, the album depicts the different classes of people \\n\\t\\tas animals with pigs being at the top of the social chain, dropping down to the sheep as the mindless herd following what they are told, with dogs as \\n\\t\\tthe business bosses getting fat on the money and power they hold over the other. Although it\\'s been a long time since 1977, the narrative of the album \\n\\t\\tstill resonates today as our social and economical situation mirrors that of the time. The album\\'s iconic cover shows an inflatable pig (now known as Algie) floating between two chimneys of the Battersea Power Station, conceived by Roger \\n\\t\\tWaters, and designed by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis Studios. For this new release, the artwork has been re-designed for the \\n\\t\\tmodern era by Storm\\'s Hipgnosis partner Aubrey \\'Po\\' Powell. Taking new shots of the building as it appeared during the recent conversion work, Po \\n\\t\\texperimented with new angles and produce some striking new takes on the classic original. Po elaborates: \"With the original 1977 album cover being such \\n\\t\\tan iconic piece of stand-alone art, I had the chance to update it, which was a rather daunting task, but Hipgnosis took the opportunity to re-photograph \\n\\t\\tthe image to reflect a changing world, and by using modern digital colouring techniques I kept Pink Floyd\\'s rather bleak message of moral decay using \\n\\t\\tthe Orwellian themes of animals, the pig \\'Algie\\', faithful to the message of the album\". Pink Floyd\\'s \\'Animals 2018 Remix\\' is available to pre-order here . 23 June 2022 \\'HEY HEY RISE UP\\' LIMITED EDITION 7\" AND CD SINGLE Pink Floyd is to release \\n\\t\\ttwo physical versions of their first newly recorded music in over 25 years, Hey Hey Rise Up . The single, which was initially released digitally in April in support of the people of Ukraine and was Number 1 in 27 countries, will be available \\n\\t\\ton 7\" and CD single. Both formats will also feature a newly reworked version of A Great Day For Freedom taken from the band\\'s 1994 album, The Division Bell . The single will be available on 15 July (excluding Japan – released on 3 August – and USA, Canada, Australia and \\n\\t\\tMexico – released on 21 October). The lead track sees David Gilmour and Nick Mason joined by long time Pink Floyd bass player Guy Pratt and Nitin Sawhney on keyboards and featuring vocals by \\n\\t\\tAndriy Khlyvnyuk of Ukrainian band Boombox. When the track was first recorded at the end of March, Andriy, who left his band\\'s US tour to return home and fight for his country, was in a hospital \\n\\t\\tbed in Kyiv recovering from a shrapnel injury. Proceeds for the physical release and the ongoing digital proceeds will go to Ukraine humanitarian relief. For this limited edition release, David Gilmour has reworked A Great Day For Freedom using the original tapes which feature Nick Mason on drums and \\n\\t\\tRichard Wright on keyboards, along with backing vocals from Sam Brown, Claudia Fontaine and Durga McBroom. The track was composed by Gilmour with lyrics \\n\\t\\tby Polly Samson and himself. Speaking about the song in 1994, Gilmour said, \"There was a wonderful moment of optimism when the Berlin wall came down – the \\n\\t\\trelease of Eastern Europe from the non-democratic side of the socialist system. But what they have now doesn\\'t seem to be much better. Again, I\\'m fairly \\n\\t\\tpessimistic about it all. I sort of wish and I live in hope, but I tend to think that history moves at a much slower pace than we think it does. I feel \\n\\t\\tthat real change takes a long, long time\". Talking about the inspiration for Hey Hey Rise Up Gilmour commented, \"Any war, but particularly a war that is started by a world superpower \\n\\t\\tagainst an independent democratic nation, has got to raise enormous anger and frustration in one. As I said before, I have a small connection there; my \\n\\t\\tdaughter-in-law is from Ukraine. And the band Boombox are Ukrainian people that I already knew, not well, but from some time ago. It\\'s an enormously \\n\\t\\tdifficult, frustrating, and anger-making thing that one human being could have the power to invade another independent democratic nation and set about \\n\\t\\tkilling the population. It\\'s just obscene to an extent that is just beyond my belief\". The artwork for the track The Sunflower Look features a painting of the national flower of Ukraine with a twist by the Cuban artist Yosan Leon. \\n\\t\\tThe cover is a direct reference to the woman who was seen around the world giving sunflower seeds to Russian soldiers and telling them to carry them in \\n\\t\\ttheir pockets, so that when they die sunflowers will grow. 15 May 2022 Pink Floyd invites you to join us in our support of the people of Ukraine with a collection featuring art created for Ukraine. The \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSunflower is the national flower of Ukraine painted by Cuban artist Yosan Leon, in direct reference to the seeds given to Russian \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsoldiers so that when they are gone flowers will grow. The Kherson Defenders painting by Ukrainian artist Sana Shahmuradova. The \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpainting, that was part of the Hey Hey Rise Up music video was \"inspired by a civilian from [Russian-occupied] Kherson who \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tjumped on a Russian tank with a Ukrainian flag\". Pink Floyd will donate all net proceeds to Ukraine Humanitarian relief along with proceeds from their April 8th release of Hey Hey Rise Up with David Gilmour and Nick Mason joined by long-time Pink Floyd bass player Guy Pratt and Nitin Sawhney on \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tkeyboards, all accompanying an extraordinary vocal by Andriy Khlyvnyuk of the Ukrainian band Boombox. Visit the collection here . 7 April 2022 HEY HEY RISE UP Pink Floyd are releasing a new single \\n\\t\\tin support of the people of Ukraine entitled Hey Hey Rise Up . The single will be available on all streaming and download platforms from midnight tonight. \\n\\t\\tThis is the first new original music that they have recorded together as a band since 1994\\'s The Division Bell . The track sees David Gilmour and Nick Mason joined by long-time Pink Floyd bass player Guy Pratt and Nitin Sawhney on keyboards and features an \\n\\t\\textraordinary vocal performance by Andriy Khlyvnyuk of Ukrainian band Boombox. The track, recorded last Wednesday (30th March), uses Andriy\\'s vocals taken from his Instagram post of \\n\\t\\thim singing in Kyiv\\'s Sofiyskaya Square. The song itself, The Red Viburnum In The Meadow , is a rousing Ukrainian protest song written during the first \\n\\t\\tworld war which has been taken up across the world over the past month in protest of the invasion of Ukraine. The title of the Pink Floyd track is taken \\n\\t\\tfrom the last line of the song which translates as \\'Hey Hey Rise up and rejoice\\'. The song\\'s opening choral parts are by Ukrainian VERYOVKA Folk Song \\n\\t\\tand Dance Ensemble. David, who has a Ukrainian daughter-in-law and grandchildren says: \"We, like so many, have been feeling the fury and the frustration of this vile \\n\\t\\tact of an independent, peaceful democratic country being invaded and having its people murdered by one of the world\\'s major powers\". He explains how he came to know Andriy and his band Boombox. \"In 2015, I played a show at Koko in London in support of the Belarus Free Theatre, \\n\\t\\twhose members have been imprisoned. Pussy Riot and the Ukrainian band, Boombox, were also on the bill. They were supposed to do their own set, \\n\\t\\tbut their singer Andriy had visa problems, so the rest of the band backed me for my set – we played Wish You Were Here for Andriy that \\n\\t\\tnight. Recently I read that Andriy had left his American tour with Boombox, had gone back to Ukraine, and joined up with the Territorial Defense. \\n\\t\\tThen I saw this incredible video on Instagram, where he stands in a square in Kyiv with this beautiful gold-domed church and sings in the silence \\n\\t\\tof a city with no traffic or background noise because of the war. It was a powerful moment that made me want to put it to music.\" While writing the music for the track, David managed to speak with Andriy from his hospital bed in Kyiv where he was recovering from a mortar \\n\\t\\tshrapnel injury. \"I played him a little bit of the song down the phone line and he gave me his blessing. We both hope to do something together \\n\\t\\tin person in the future.\" Speaking about the track David says, \"I hope it will receive wide support and publicity. We want to raise funds for humanitarian charities and raise \\n\\t\\tmorale. We want to express our support for Ukraine and, in that way, show that most of the world thinks that it is totally wrong for a superpower to \\n\\t\\tinvade the independent democratic country that Ukraine has become\". The video for Hey Hey Rise Up was filmed by acclaimed director Mat Whitecross and shot on the same day as the track was recorded. David \\n\\t\\tGilmour: \"We recorded the track and video in our barn where we did all our Von Trapped Family live streams during lockdown. It\\'s the same room that \\n\\t\\twe did the \\'Barn Jams\\' in with Rick Wright back in 2007. Janina Pedan made the set in a day and we had Andriy singing on the screen while we played, \\n\\t\\tso the four of us had a vocalist, albeit not one who was physically present with us\". The artwork for the track features a painting of the national flower of Ukraine, the sunflower, by the Cuban artist, Yosan Leon. The cover of the \\n\\t\\tsingle is a direct reference to the woman who was seen around the world giving sunflower seeds to Russian soldiers and telling them to carry them \\n\\t\\tin their pockets so that when they die, sunflowers will grow. All proceeds will go towards Ukrainian humanitarian relief. 11 March 2022 To stand with the world in strongly condemning Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, the works of Pink Floyd, from 1987 onwards, and all of \\n\\t\\tDavid Gilmour\\'s solo recordings are being removed from all digital music providers in Russia and Belarus from today. 28 December 2021 NICK MASON\\'S SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS It is with great regret that due to the uncertainty surrounding the Covid pandemic, it has been decided to postpone the North American tour until later \\n\\t\\tin the year. Apologies for any inconvenience or disappointment due to this. We are working on rescheduling the dates and will announce them as soon as \\n\\t\\twe can. Ticket holders are advised to await further information from the venue and/or ticket company where they purchased their tickets. 16 December 2021 PINK FLOYD – P•U•L•S•E• RESTORED & RE-EDITED Warner Music for Europe and Sony Music for outside Europe today \\n\\t\\tannounced that Pink Floyd\\'s P•U•L•S•E• Restored & Re-Edited , will be released for the first time on Blu-ray on 18 February 2022. The P•U•L•S•E• concert film (helmed by esteemed director David Mallet) will be available as 2x Blu-ray and 2x DVD deluxe box sets, with the video footage \\n\\t\\thaving been expertly re-edited by Aubrey Powell/Hipgnosis from the original tape masters especially for The Later Years release in 2019. The cover \\n\\t\\tdesign, originally created by Storm Thorgerson and Peter Curzon for the 2006 DVD release, has also been updated with photography by Aubrey Powell/Hipgnosis \\n\\t\\tand Rupert Truman/StormStudios. The packaging artwork is designed by Peter Curzon from StormStudios, under the direction of Aubrey Powell/Hignosis. This release also sees the reintroduction of the iconic pulsating light as per the original 1995 CD release, this time operated by two replaceable AA \\n\\t\\tbatteries. The deluxe packages include music videos, concert screen films, documentaries, Pulse Tour rehearsal footage and more, alongside a 60-page \\n\\t\\tbooklet. P•U•L•S•E• , originally released as an album in 1995, was recorded on the European leg of the Division Bell tour and the DVD and Blu-ray packages \\n\\t\\tinclude the whole live performance of The Dark Side Of The Moon – the only full live filmed recording of this seminal album. The concert, \\n\\t\\tfilmed on 20 October 1994 at Earls Court in London, saw Pink Floyd play some of their classic tracks as well as highlights from the recently released \\n\\t\\talbum The Division Bell . Standout tracks include High Hopes , Keep Talking , Sorrow , Wish You Were Here , Comfortably Numb and The Great Gig In The Sky . Nick Mason reflects on the original CD release and the pulsing LED light: \"Essentially, it\\'s a device which we thought was entertaining. It\\'s an idea of \\n\\t\\tStorm Thorgerson\\'s which related to The Dark Side Of The Moon and the pulse, and it\\'s a live album so the box is \\'alive\\'. After that, in terms of \\n\\t\\tseriously deep meanings, one might be struggling a bit\".

Congratulations. 24 September 2021 YET ANOTHER MOVIE DEMO \"I thought, this week, that we would put up the original demo, written by Pat Leonard and myself, for what was to become \\'Yet Another Movie\\' on \\n\\t\\tthe \\'A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\' album. \"Pat Leonard and I met up at Astoria in September 1986 a couple of days after I had played on a Bryan Ferry track that he was producing. \"We had a glass or two of wine and jammed for hours. For some reason that I can no longer remember I had chosen the fretless bass as my instrument \\n\\t\\tof the day. \"It turned into a beautiful song.\" – David Gilmour 2 September 2021 PINK FLOYD \\'A MOMENTARY LAPSE OF REASON\\' REMIXED & UPDATED – RELEASED 29TH OCTOBER Remixed and updated from the original 1987 master tapes for The Later Years by Andy Jackson with David Gilmour, assisted by Damon Iddins, A Momentary Lapse Of Reason will be available on Vinyl, CD, DVD, Blu-ray and digitally with Stereo and 5.1 mixes and can be pre-ordered here . In addition, for the first time, the album will be presented \\n\\t\\tin 360 Reality Audio, a new immersive music experience that closely mimics the omni-directional soundscape of live musical performance for the \\n\\t\\tlistener using Sony\\'s object-based 360 Spatial Sound technologies. A Momentary Lapse Of Reason will also be released in Dolby Audio and UHD \\n\\t\\tin addition to 360 Reality Audio, all of which will continue with other Pink Floyd releases. The release of The Later Years project in 2019 gave an opportunity for a fresh overview of the album, originally released in 1987. By returning \\n\\t\\tto some of Richard Wright\\'s original keyboard takes, and by re-recording new drum tracks with Nick Mason, producers David Gilmour and Bob Ezrin have \\n\\t\\trestored a better creative balance between the three Pink Floyd members. David Gilmour \"Some years after we had recorded the album, we came to the conclusion that we should update it to make it more timeless, featuring more of the \\n\\t\\ttraditional instruments that we liked and that we were more used to playing. This was something we thought it would benefit from. We also looked for \\n\\t\\tand found some previously unused keyboard parts of Rick\\'s which helped us to come up with a new vibe, a new feeling for the album.\" David reflects on originally recording the album: \"Bob Ezrin had worked on \\'The Wall\\' with us back in \\'79 and on some solo albums with me. I learnt a \\n\\t\\tlot from Bob and he\\'s a valuable person to have on board. We started working on pieces of music that I had been writing and, come Christmas, we knew it \\n\\t\\twas going well. One day, I felt this \\'thing\\' coming on me that became Sorrow. I wrote five verses one evening. They just flowed out from nowhere in \\n\\t\\tone of those great serendipitous moments that you recognize later as having been very valuable... I knew that we were on a good roll and that this thing \\n\\t\\twas going to work\". Nick Mason \"Initially it seemed a bit odd to start re-assembling a record after 35-odd years, but the public\\'s appetite for alternate views of the same work has \\n\\t\\tundoubtedly increased immeasurably over time. \"Inevitably the opportunity to revisit earlier work from a period where digital technology was the brave new world became increasingly interesting. \"There\\'s little doubt of the advantages in being able to find new elements within the music, or more often uncovering elements that became overwhelmed \\n\\t\\twith all that new science... I think there is an element of taking the album back in time and taking the opportunity to create a slightly more open \\n\\t\\tsound – utilising some of the things we had learned from playing so much of the album live over two massive tours. \"I enjoyed re-recording drum tracks with unlimited studio time. Momentary Lapse had been recorded under considerable stress and time constraints, and \\n\\t\\tindeed some of the final mixing was done at the same time as rehearsals for the forthcoming tour. \"It was also nice to have an opportunity to enhance some of Rick\\'s work. Again, that positive tidal wave of technology just might have provided too \\n\\t\\tmany digital opportunities to overwhelm the band feel. Hopefully, that\\'s one of the benefits of this remix!\" The remixed and updated A Momentary Lapse Of Reason album also features a new album cover using an alternative beds photo by Robert Dowling from \\n\\t\\tthe original album cover shoot directed by the late Storm Thorgerson. Echoing the iconic original sleeve the 2021 album artwork is designed and art \\n\\t\\tdirected by Aubrey Powell/Hipgnosis and Peter Curzon/StormStudios. Aubrey Powell explained, \"I was looking to update the iconic five hundred beds picture my partner in Hipgnosis, Storm Thorgerson, had designed. On \\n\\t\\tlooking through the archives I discovered a version where the sea was encroaching on the set, just before Storm shut down the shot, worried he would \\n\\t\\tlose all the beds. I also wanted to make something more of the microlight. There were no shots of the plane in close-up, so I hunted one down that was \\n\\t\\tsimilar but white, and had Peter Curzon retouch the fuselage with the right colouring – red – then strip the microlight into the picture in \\n\\t\\tan upfront position. David Gilmour and Nick Mason gave their approval and, voilà, a fresh approach to an original favourite\". The album will be available as single CD, CD +DVD set, CD + Blu-Ray set, 2 x 180gm LP set, the latter cut at half-speed at 45rpm for enhanced sound \\n\\t\\tquality, with pre-orders from 2 September. A special version of the video Learning To Fly is available simultaneously with Sony 360RA immersive \\n\\t\\taudio: if you watch the video on YouTube with headphones you experience simulated 360RA sound.

Peter\\'s company Electronic Music Studios (EMS) created instruments such as the portable VCS3 and \\n\\t\\tSynthi A, which formed a key part of Pink Floyd\\'s sound on every album between 1972\\'s Obscured By Clouds and 1977\\'s Animals , \\n\\t\\twith On The Run from 1973\\'s The Dark Side of The Moon being a great example of their use.

A very happy birthday to Polly Samson, best-selling author and lyricist for Pink Floyd and David Gilmour. Here are Polly and David in Olympic Studios \\n\\t\\tduring The Division Bell sessions in 1993. 17 March 2021 THE LYRICS OF SYD BARRETT PUBLISHED Pink Floyd \\n\\t\\tco-founder Syd Barrett\\'s influence was profound and long-lasting, despite tenure with the band lasting a mere three years. If his guitar gave the \\n\\t\\tband a distinctive hallucinatory sound, his often obscure and surreal lyrics were perhaps even more intoxicating. Perhaps surprisingly, up until now Syd\\'s lyrics were never officially annotated, but that omission has been rectified with the publication last \\n\\t\\tmonth of The Lyrics of Syd Barrett by Omnibus Press. This first authorised collection represents the most definitive versions possible, \\n\\t\\tafter much study and input from David Gilmour and Syd biographer Rob Chapman, involving in some works the auditioning of isolated vocals from \\n\\t\\tthe original master tape recordings. Compiled in collaboration with the Syd Barrett estate, the book includes a foreword from former Pink Floyd manager Peter Jenner and a comprehensive \\n\\t\\tintroduction by biographer Rob Chapman. Accompanying the lyrics to all 52 songs written for Pink Floyd and Syd\\'s subsequent solo career are rare \\n\\t\\tphotos and artwork, making The Lyrics of Syd Barrett a beautifully illustrated insight into one of rock music\\'s most imaginative and searing minds. You can purchase The Lyrics of Syd Barrett here . 10 March 2021 PINK FLOYD LIVE AT KNEBWORTH 1990 Pink Floyd Live at Knebworth 1990 will be released for the first time on CD, double vinyl and digital platforms on Friday 30th April 2021 . \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe concert was part of the star-studded 1990 Silver Clef Winners performance at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, headlined by Pink Floyd. The monumentous Knebworth concert saw Pink Floyd topping the all-star bill that included Paul McCartney, Dire Straits, Genesis, Phil Collins, \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMark Knopfler, Robert Plant (with Jimmy Page), Cliff Richard, Eric Clapton, and Tears For Fears. Around 120,000 music fans saw these giants of rock \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tappear on the hallowed stage of Knebworth, all in aid of the Nordoff Robbins charity, profits from which went towards setting up the BRIT School. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe concert was broadcast globally on MTV. Pink Floyd – David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright – were joined on stage by members of their touring band including Guy Pratt, \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJon Carin, Tim Renwick, and Gary Wallis. Backing vocals came from Durga McBroom, Sam Brown and her mother Vicki, and (original The Great Gig in \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Sky vocalist) Clare Torry. Pink Floyd also welcomed guest musicians including sax player Candy Dulfer and keyboard player and composer Michael \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tKamen. David Gilmour and Andy Jackson have remixed the audio from this iconic concert featuring all seven tracks performed on the day, and the album \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfeatures new artwork shot by Floyd collaborator Aubrey \\'Po\\' Powell of Hipgnosis and designed by Peter Curzon of StormStudios.

The song, written by David and Polly, features the voice and harp playing of their daughter Romany. The inspiration for the track was taken \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Polly Samson\\'s new novel A Theatre for Dreamers . This 7\" version features a previously unheard alternate mix of the track by \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAndy Jackson. Of Yes, I Have Ghosts , David says \"I was working on this song just as we went in to lockdown and had to cancel a session with backing \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsingers but, as it turned out, the solution was right here and I couldn\\'t be happier with the way Romany\\'s voice blends with mine and her \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbeautiful harp playing has been another revelation\". The song was digitally released in the summer and was previously only available as part of the ground-breaking audiobook for the novel. Polly \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSamson, who wrote the lyrics: \"Collaborating with David – as I have done many times over the last 30 years, writing songs for both Pink Floyd \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand his solo albums – we were able to bring together the worlds of literature and music to enhance the listening experience and connect with \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taudiences in a way which I don\\'t think has been done before\". Set on the idyllic Greek island of Hydra in 1960, A Theatre for Dreamers captures the hazy, sun-drenched days of an expat bohemian community \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof poets, painters, and musicians, including a twenty-five-year-old Leonard Cohen. Before the Covid-19 lockdown, David, Polly and family were about to take A Theatre for Dreamers on the road for a short series of shows blending \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twords and music. Sadly, these dates have had to be postponed until June 2021 but the \\'Von Trapped Family\\', as they dubbed themselves, took to Facebook \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tto host live stream-adapted versions of the shows. Viewers found themselves transported to the Greek island of Hydra in 1960, with readings from the book, poetry, Q&A sessions and music from and inspired \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tby the novel, including instrumental sections of Yes, I Have Ghosts and songs by Leonard Cohen. The Sunday Times bestseller A Theatre for Dreamers by Polly Samson is out now and published by Bloomsbury. A Theatre for Dreamers audiobook is available here . Yes, I Have Ghosts by David Gilmour (featuring Romany Gilmour) is released by Sony Music on Friday 27th November. 24 September 2020 DELICATE SOUND OF THUNDER INSTORE FROM 20TH NOVEMBER Photo: Dimo Safari. The release of the restored, re-edited and remixed version of Delicate Sound of Thunder has been announced for Friday 20th November. \\n\\t\\tOriginally available solely on VHS and Laser disc, the Grammy Award-nominated programme has been completely restored and re-edited under the direction \\n\\t\\tof Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis, with the sound remixed by Andy Jackson with David Gilmour. It will be available on Blu-ray and DVD, with audio-only \\n\\t\\tversions on 2-CD or 3-LP, plus a Deluxe 4-disc version including 2-CDs plus Blu-ray and DVD, each of which contain five bonus tracks. Delicate Sound of Thunder was filmed a year into the triumphant record-breaking Momentary Lapse of Reason tour at the Nassau Coliseum in \\n\\t\\tLong Island, New York. Although the actual final live date was in June 1990, this concert presentation celebrated the last shows of 1988 – filmed and \\n\\t\\trecorded over a 5-night run in August. Originally directed by Wayne Isham, the new version was sourced directly from hundreds of cans of original 35mm \\n\\t\\tnegatives, painstakingly restored and transferred to 4K, with the show completely re-edited by Benny Trickett, under the creative direction of Aubrey \\n\\t\\tPowell/Hipgnosis. Similarly, the sound was completely remixed from the original multitrack tapes by longtime Pink Floyd engineer Andy Jackson with \\n\\t\\tDavid Gilmour, assisted by Damon Iddins. Seen and heard playing alongside David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright are: Jon Carin (Keyboards, Vocals); Tim Renwick (Guitars, Vocals); Guy Pratt \\n\\t\\t(Bass, Vocals); Gary Wallis (Percussion); Scott Page (Saxophones, Guitar); Margret Taylor (Backing Vocals); Rachel Fury (Backing Vocals); and Durga \\n\\t\\tMcBroom (Backing Vocals). Film Producers were Curt Marvis and Carl Wyant and Director of Photography was Marc Reshovsky, with Lighting Design by Marc Brickman. \\n\\t\\tContent varies from format to format: Blu-ray and DVD include 16 songs in 115 minutes, with the 3-LP and 2-CD containing 23 songs each (nine more than the original \\n\\t\\tvinyl release and eight more than the original 2-CD). All formats include a 24-page booklet, while the Deluxe box has a 40-page booklet, a double-sided poster and \\n\\t\\tfive postcards. The set list carefully balances then-new material from A Momentary Lapse of Reason and Pink Floyd classics, including four songs from The Dark \\n\\t\\tSide of the Moon , the anthemic title track of Wish You Were Here , Comfortably Numb and a cathartic Run Like Hell . As a record of \\n\\t\\tthe creative power of David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright, Delicate Sound of Thunder presents them at their incendiary best. Delicate Sound of Thunder can be pre-ordered here . 21 August 2020 UPDATE – The cinema release of Delicate Sound of Thunder, scheduled for 15 October, has been cancelled. 20 July 2020 NICK MASON\\'S SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS UK TOUR POSTPONED Due to the uncertainty surrounding us all due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been decided that Nick Mason\\'s Saucerful Of Secrets UK tour, due to take place \\n\\t\\tfrom 1 October, is to be rescheduled for April/May 2021. The new tour dates are shown above. It is important to the band that those who are planning to attend the shows are able to do so safely and without concern for their health and wellbeing. To \\n\\t\\tachieve this, and to allow people the opportunity to plan their travel to and from the concerts, postponing until April 2021 was the best option.

On 7th & 8th July 2016, David Gilmour performed two spectacular solo shows at the legendary Pompeii Amphitheatre in the shadow \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof Mount Vesuvius, 45 years after he first played there for Adrian Maben\\'s classic film, Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii . The concerts were the first-ever rock performances played to an audience in the ancient Roman amphitheatre, which was built in 90 BC and \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tentombed in ash when Vesuvius erupted in AD 79. David Gilmour is the only performer to play to an audience in the arena since the time of \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe gladiators, almost 2,000 years ago. The film was shot in hi-res 4K by director Gavin Elder and released in over 2,000 cinemas worldwide in 2017. The concert features songs from \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthroughout David\\'s career, including the title tracks of his two most recent No. 1 solo albums: Rattle That Lock ; and On An Island ;  \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tas well as Pink Floyd classics, and an extraordinary performance of The Great Gig In The Sky from The Dark Side of the Moon , which \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid rarely plays as a solo artist.

Pink Floyd Records has supported Record Store Day since the \\n\\t\\tlabel\\'s launch in June 2016, so this release is slightly different from the version that appeared in the recent The Later Years box set. The limited-edition, one-sided Record Store Day 7\" vinyl single boasts new artwork for the release featuring a person caught \\'red-handed\\' in handcuffs. \\n\\t\\tPink Floyd Creative Director Aubrey Powell oversaw the sleeve, newly created by long-time Floyd collaborators, photographer Rupert Truman and designer \\n\\t\\tPeter Curzon, both of StormStudios. New art extends to the B-side of the single, which features a new and exclusive etching of handcuffs to echo the \\n\\t\\tsleeve and the song\\'s lyrics. The single represents the last live performance of Pink Floyd with David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright all together in 2007, from the Syd Barrett \\n\\t\\ttribute concert The Madcap\\'s Last Laugh, at The Barbican Theatre, London, on 10 May 2007. The Pink Floyd members were augmented by Jon Carin (Keyboards, \\n\\t\\tvocals) and Andy Bell from Oasis on bass guitar. Held to pay homage to Syd, who had died a year earlier, the concert, produced by Nick Laird-Clowes with \\n\\t\\tAssociate Producer Joe Boyd, sadly featured the final performance of the band to include Richard Wright, who passed away the year after. Record Store Day has become a landmark occasion for thousands of independent record shops around the world, involving special exclusive vinyl releases, \\n\\t\\twhile many shops and cities host artist performances and events to mark the occasion. 26 February 2020 DAVID GILMOUR\\'S TRIBUTE TO PETER GREEN David Gilmour with Mick Fleetwood. Photo: Polly Samson. As previously announced, David Gilmour performed last night as one of the special guests assembled by Mick Fleetwood to celebrate the life and music of Fleetwood Mac \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfounder Peter Green at The London Palladium. Although Peter Green\\'s time with the band was to be short-lived, his songs and performances attracted much acclaim, \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tand the regard in which they are still held was reflected in the musicians chosen to perform them. A stellar lineup excelled themselves: John Mayall, Jonny Lang, Rick Vito, Billy Gibbons, Christine McVie, Steven Tyler, Kirk Hammett, Pete Townshend, and Noel \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGallagher gave inspiring renditions of the mostly blues-based early Mac material, while Neil Finn was moving on the emotional Man Of The World . Surprise appearance of the night was fourth original member Jeremy Spencer, appearing on stage with Mick Fleetwood for the first time in fifty years. His \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tslide guitar and vocals, undiminished by time, elicited a great response from the crowd. Another first was David Gilmour\\'s rendition of Oh Well Part 2 , apparently the only time it had ever been performed live by Fleetwood Mac. Backed by the \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thouse band of Mick Fleetwood, Andy Fairweather Low, Rick Vito, Dave Bronze and Ricky Peterson, David reproduced the reverberant guitar from the original for \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe first part of the tune. He then paid tribute in his own style, with a superb bluesy sequence of phrases, playing from the heart – a perfect summation \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tof the spirit of the evening. David returned on lap steel guitar, duetting with Rick Vito on slide for the penultimate song of the show, the instrumental Albatross . David\\'s \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdistinctive tone, with volume swells, carried the set to sublime heights before the final ensemble closing rendition of Shake Your Moneymaker , the \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tElmore James classic from the first Fleetwood Mac album. The concert was designed by Mick Fleetwood to \\'recognize the profound impact Peter and the early Fleetwood Mac had on the world of music\\' and it certainly \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tachieved that goal. It was filmed and recorded for future release. 25 February 2020 PETER GREEN TRIBUTE CONCERT: REHEARSALS 12 February 2020 A THEATRE FOR DREAMERS – AN EVENING OF WORDS AND MUSIC WITH POLLY SAMSON AND DAVID GILMOUR Monday 30th March – Manchester, Royal Northern College of Music Tuesday 31st March – Birmingham, Town Hall Thursday 2nd April – London, Central Hall Westminster Join Polly Samson and friends to launch her new novel A Theatre for Dreamers at an evening of words and music in Manchester, \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBirmingham and London. Each of these special events will feature Polly Samson in conversation with journalist Rosie Boycott, readings, film and live music, \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tincluding a new song Yes, I Have Ghosts written by David Gilmour and Polly Samson. The audience will be transported to the Greek island of Hydra in 1960, and a world dancing on the edge of revolution, where a circle of \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpoets, painters, writers and musicians live tangled lives. It\\'s a story of utopian dreams and innocence lost, of the troubled King and \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tQueen of Bohemia, Charmian Clift and George Johnson, of a young poet named Leonard Cohen, and his Marianne; and of Erica Hart, an \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t18-year-old in search of answers. Ticket prices include a signed first edition of A Theatre for Dreamers and an exclusive portrait of Polly Samson and David Gilmour \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttaken on Hydra and signed by them both. \\'In A Theatre for Dreamers , Polly Samson goes to the Greek island of Hydra to imagine the first steps in the love affair between \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLeonard Cohen and his Marianne. As dreamily nostalgic as Cohen\\'s song Famous Blue Raincoat\\' OBSERVER , Fiction to look out for in 2020 \\'It is a grand read and the prose falls translucently like the air ... Superb work and a delightful novel\\' THOMAS KENEALLY \\'Polly Samson has created such a dazzling evocation of an era and its mindset. Here, the island of Hydra is a geographical place but \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta psychological one too, populated by beautiful and damaged characters who pull you down into its pages for another café gossip, \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tanother moonlit swim, another drink. This book is a bohemian idyll meticulously drawn, and unsparingly exposed. It is like going away to \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tparadise, then coming back rather wiser.

As previously announced, David Gilmour performed last night at London\\'s \\n          Royal Albert Hall, as a special guest at the 70th Birthday Celebration \\n          of singer/songwriter/guitarist and Fairport Convention co-founder Richard \\n          Thompson. Apppearing towards the close of a concert full of stellar guests, David \\n          performed Richard\\'s The Dimming Of The Day , including an incendiary \\n          solo. The song had of course previously featured on the David Gilmour \\n          In Concert DVD from the Royal Festival Hall. Richard supplied sympathetic \\n          electric guitar behind David\\'s lead vocal on Fat Old Sun , culminating \\n          in an exchange of guitar solos between the two that was a masterclass \\n          in dynamics and taste. The show was a fitting tribute to Richard Thompson\\'s artistry, including \\n          as it did the cream of Britain\\'s folk-rock world as well as some possibly \\n          more surprising guests, such as Hugh Cornwell (a former schoolmate of \\n          Richard\\'s) and Bob Mould from Hüsker Dü and Sugar. The entire \\n          ensemble, including David, assembled for the traditional Fairport Convention \\n          encore of Richard\\'s classic Meet On The Ledge , a fitting end \\n          to an astonishing evening of musical virtuosity. 27 September 2019 HIGH HOPES (EARLY VERSION) AVAILABLE AS AN INSTANT \\n          GRAT An iTunes audio Instant Grat is a way for consumers to get a \\n          track in advance of an album release, which acts as a \\'deposit\\' against \\n          a subsequent purchase of the digital version of the album, slotting \\n          into the full downloaded file. High Hopes (Early Version) has \\n          just been made available as the second Instant Grat from Pink Floyd\\'s \\n          forthcoming Box Set The Later Years , and the video clip can be \\n          seen here . The Later Years, compiled into 5 x CDs, 6 x Blu-rays and 5 x DVDs, plus \\n          2 x 7\" singles, and accompanied with lavish and detailed extras, annotates \\n          the latter years of Pink Floyd, from 1987 to the present. As the title \\n          suggests, this version of High Hopes is an early version of the \\n          song, and features an electric guitar solo and slightly different lyrics. 29 August 2019 PINK FLOYD THE LATER YEARS On Friday 29th November 2019 , Pink Floyd Records will release Pink Floyd The Later Years , a 16-disc set (5 x CDs, 6 x Blu-Rays, \\n          5 x DVDs) covering the material created by David Gilmour, Nick Mason, \\n          and Richard Wright from 1987 onwards. The period included three studio \\n          albums: A Momentary Lapse Of Reason ; The Division Bell ; \\n          and The Endless River ; as well as two live albums: Delicate \\n          Sound Of Thunder ; and Pulse . With additional production from \\n          David Gilmour and Andy Jackson, over 13 hours of unreleased audio and \\n          audiovisual material, including the sought-after 1989 Venice and 1990 \\n          Knebworth concerts, Pink Floyd The Later Years is a must for \\n          all fans. A multi-media, deluxe box set, Pink Floyd The Later Years presents \\n          an expanded view of the Pink Floyd story from 1987 to the present and \\n          kicks off with A Momentary Lapse Of Reason , the album that confirmed \\n          Pink Floyd as one of the world\\'s biggest artists. The album, presented for the first time in 5.1, has been updated and \\n          remixed by David Gilmour and Andy Jackson. The release of The Later \\n          Years project gives an opportunity for a fresh overview of the A \\n          Momentary Lapse Of Reason album. By returning to some of Richard \\n          Wright\\'s keyboard parts and recording new drum tracks with Nick Mason, \\n          producers David Gilmour and Bob Ezrin have restored the creative balance \\n          between the three Pink Floyd members. Highlights of Pink Floyd The Later Years include: Restored and remixed Delicate Sound Of Thunder on Blu-ray, DVD \\n          and 2-CD; Restored and re-edited Pulse on Blu-ray for the first time; Previously unreleased Venice concert (Blu-ray & DVD) and Knebworth \\n          concert (remixed/re-edited on Blu-ray/DVD/CD); Unseen documentaries, screen films, promo clips and the previously unreleased Endless River film. With the help of Nick Mason and the Pink Floyd archive, the box set \\n          comes with reproductions of tour artwork, posters, programmes, tour \\n          laminates, lyric book and much more, including two 7\" vinyl singles, \\n          (the live version of Arnold Layne performed at the Syd Barrett \\n          Tribute Concert in 2007 and Lost For Words from the \\'Pulse\\' tour \\n          rehearsals at Earl\\'s Court), in new picture sleeves and etched image \\n          B-sides.

The highly \\n          anticipated auction of more than 120 instruments and artefacts from \\n          David Gilmour\\'s personal collection created great excitement in the \\n          auction room as new record prices were set for contemporary musical \\n          instruments. As predicted, the instruments most closely associated with iconic recordings \\n          such as Wish You Were Here and The Dark Side of the Moon received astronomical bids from all around the world, the highest being \\n          the $3.9 million paid for David\\'s \\'Black Strat\\' Fender Stratocaster. \\n          However, the generosity of bidders and collectors from around the world \\n          enabled proceeds across the entire collection to reach the sum of $21,490,750, \\n          including buyer\\'s premium. David Gilmour described the result as \"brilliant and unbelievable\", \\n          reiterating his support for ClientEarth in their cause to use the law \\n          to bring about real change. ClientEarth, a charity that uses the power \\n          of the law to protect the planet and its people, comprises lawyers and \\n          environmental experts who are fighting against climate change and to \\n          protect nature and the environment. ClientEarth CEO James Thornton said: \"This is a truly humbling and extraordinary \\n          gift, which goes beyond our wildest expectations. It\\'s difficult to \\n          express just how deeply grateful we are to David for choosing ClientEarth \\n          as the beneficiary of this historic auction. The law is one of the most \\n          powerful tools we have to tackle the world\\'s increasing environmental \\n          problems. This gift is a phenomenal boost to our work using the law \\n          to tackle climate change and protect nature. It will allow us to play \\n          an even greater role in addressing the climate crisis and securing a \\n          healthy planet for future generations\". Click here for more information on ClientEarth. Some of the individual items\\' final bids included $3,975,000 for the \\n          \\'Black Strat\\', well above the estimated range of $100,000 to $150,000. \\n          Other big-ticket items included a 1954 Fender Stratocaster with the \\n          serial number 0001, which was used on the recording of Another Brick \\n          in the Wall Part 2 , which went for over $1.8 million. A 1958 Gretsch \\n          White Penguin sold for $447,000, and a 1955 Gibson Goldtop Les Paul, \\n          also used on Another Brick in the Wall Part 2 , sold for $447,000. \\n          Christie\\'s declared all to be \"world musical instruments auction records\". 19 June 2019 CHRISTIE\\'S GUITAR AUCTION – A MESSAGE FROM DAVID \\n          GILMOUR 14 June 2019 CHRISTIE\\'S GUITAR AUCTION – OPEN FOR VIEWING Discover The David Gilmour Guitar Collection in New York until Wednesday 19th June.

Set for release on Friday 7th June , this 25th anniversary edition will be available on translucent blue vinyl, echoing the original limited blue vinyl release in 1994. The Division Bell sleeve artwork of two huge metal heads in profile talking to each other (and in turn, creating a third forward-facing head) was provided by long-time \\n\\t\\t  Floyd collaborator Storm Thorgerson. Two three-metre tall metal head sculptures (by John Robertson), weighing 1500 kilogrammes, were placed in a field in Cambridgeshire \\n\\t\\t  and photographed across a two-week period in all weather conditions. Storm said: \"It was intended that the viewer should not see both at the same time. One saw the single face, \\n\\t\\t  or the two profiles which meant that they were then communicating with the image\". This relates directly to the album\\'s core themes of communication, talking through problems and making choices. The album was remastered for the release in 2014 by James Guthrie, Joel Plante and Doug Sax at The Mastering Lab from the original analogue tapes. Bob Ezrin and David Gilmour produced the original album, \\n\\t\\t  with orchestral arrangements by the late Michael Kamen. As with the 2014 vinyl reissue, it\\'s a 2-LP set containing all full-length versions of the tracks, as opposed to the original 1994 LP, which featured \\n\\t\\t  some edited tracks in order to fit the album on one LP.

David said: \"These guitars have been very good to me and many of them have given me pieces of music over the years. They have paid for themselves many \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttimes over, but it\\'s now time that they moved on. Guitars were made to be played and it is my wish that wherever they end up, they continue to give \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir owners the gift of music. By auctioning these guitars I hope that I can give some help where it is really needed and through my charitable \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tfoundation do some good in this world. It will be a wrench to see them go and perhaps one day I\\'ll have to track one or two of them down and buy them \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tback!\" For more details, please visit https://www.christies.com/auctions/the-david-gilmour-collection . 29 December 2018 NICK MASON HONOURED Many congratulations to Nick Mason for being awarded Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the British New Year\\'s Honours list, which has just been announced. \\n\\t\\t  Nick will receive the award for services to music. 14 December 2018 DAVID GILMOUR PERFORMS WITH THE PRETTY THINGS AND VAN MORRISON David Gilmour fulfilled his promise last night to former Harvest stable mates The Pretty Things, joining them onstage at their last-ever performance. The Indigo \\n\\t\\t  space at the O2 Arena was the venue for a rapturously received, sold out show, which saw the Dartford, Kent, band officially bow out after 55 years of live \\n\\t\\t  performing. Formed by ex-Rolling Stone Dick Taylor and singer Phil May, the band went through several musical incarnations in their career, all represented \\n\\t\\t  across a 3-part set spanning three hours. The central section included a large portion of the band\\'s rock opera S. F. Sorrow , certainly one of the first, which was released on EMI\\'s Harvest imprint \\n\\t\\t  in December 1968, produced by Norman Smith. At last night\\'s show, David played on several tracks from the album, including She Says Good Morning , Baron Saturday , I See You , and Old Man Going , as well as adding exhilarating solos to Cries From The Midnight Circus , from the subsequent Parachute album . The farewell show also featured guest appearances from Van Morrison, who joined David alongside The Pretty Things on one of the encores, a high energy rendition \\n\\t\\t  of Bo Diddley\\'s Roadrunner , originally included on the Pretty Things\\' 1965 debut album, helping to bring things full circle. For those who were there it \\n\\t\\t  was a very exciting night, the contributions of the special guests helping to celebrate one of the UK\\'s original 1960\\'s musical pioneers. 7 December 2018 SOUL MUSIC: SHINE ON YOU CRAZY DIAMOND BBC Radio 4\\'s Soul Music programme on Wednesday 26th December (9.00am, repeated at 9.30pm; then available, as a podcast, on the BBC Sounds app.) features Shine On You Crazy Diamond discussed by voices \\n\\t\\t  including David Gilmour. Written about Syd Barrett, their former band member, it\\'s both a tribute, and a call for him to \"shine on\" despite suffering \\n\\t\\t  serious mental health issues. David Gilmour recalls the legendary day that Syd Barrett unexpectedly appeared in the studio where they were recording Wish You Were Here , the album bookended by Shine On . Nobody recognised Syd at first; once handsome and slender, he\\'d gained weight and \\n\\t\\t  shaved his head and eyebrows. Another contributor to the programme, Anna Gascoigne, talks about the pain of losing her son, Jay. He was a gentle boy, a talented musician, who eventually \\n\\t\\t  succumbed to the multiple mental health problems he had battled for years. Shine On You Crazy Diamond , for Anna, speaks directly to her of Jay; he \\n\\t\\t  loved Pink Floyd and Shine On was played at his memorial service. Anna, herself, was driven to the brink of suicide by her son\\'s death. It was the support \\n\\t\\t  of her family – including her brother, Paul Gascoigne – that helped her to carry on. Ed Steelefox, a DJ based in Worcester, describes a New Year\\'s Eve house-party of a few years ago: as the guests gradually fell asleep he chose to slip out the \\n\\t\\t  door leaving a non-stop playlist of different, live, versions of \\'Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\' to penetrate their dreams. And Professor Allan Moore, a regular Soul Music contributor, takes to the grand piano to play and talk about what it is in the track that is so directly \\n\\t\\t  reminiscent of Syd Barrett. 31 October 2018 NICK MASON\\'S SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS ANNOUNCES FIRST-EVER NORTH AMERICAN TOUR Nick Mason\\'s \\n\\t\\t  Saucerful Of Secrets have announced their first-ever North American tour in 2019 with stops in Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto, and New York. \\n\\t\\t  Collecting rave reviews as they introduced their unique live show of early Pink Floyd to sold-out UK and European audiences in 2018, the 28-date tour \\n\\t\\t  kicks off March 12, 2019 in Vancouver, British Columbia, at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre and concludes April 22, 2019 in Washington, D.C. at DAR \\n\\t\\t  Constitution Hall. This tour marks Pink Floyd co-founder and drummer Nick Mason\\'s first performances in North America since Pink Floyd\\'s July 18, 1994 concert at Giants \\n\\t\\t  Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, as part of the Division Bell Tour. \"With the help of some like-minded friends, I have embarked on a voyage of discovery of the music that was the launch pad of Pink Floyd and my working \\n\\t\\t  life,\" says Mason. \"It seems too early to retire, and I missed the interaction with other musicians.\" Nick Mason\\'s Saucerful Of Secrets is Nick Mason, Spandau Ballet guitarist Gary Kemp, longtime Pink Floyd touring bassist Guy Pratt, guitarist \\n\\t\\t  Lee Harris, and keyboardist Dom Beken.

Pink Floyd bassist and co-lead vocalist Roger Waters began conceptualizing The Wall in 1977, and presented the idea to the rest of the band in July 1978. Recording of The Wall , Pink Floyd’s eleventh studio LP, began later that year; the rock opera told the story of Pink, a burned-out rock star based on Waters’ own increasing feelings of isolation. “The idea for The Wall came from ten years of touring,” Waters explained. ”Playing to very large audiences, some of whom were our old audience who\\'d come to see us play, but most of whom were only there for the beer, in big stadiums, and consequently it became rather an alienating experience doing the shows...\" I became very conscious of a wall between us and our audience... Roger Waters ...so this record started out as being an expression of those feelings.” Released in November 1979, The Wall was a huge success, spawning three singles, a 1980-81 concert tour and a 1982 feature film. The three-part song “Another Brick in the Wall” outlines Pink’s traumatic life, from the death of his father to being the target of school bullies to a violent mental breakdown. The concert tour stage set featured a massive 340-brick wall that was built up brick by brick during the first half of the show as a physical symbol of Pink’s increasing reclusion from both his fans and society as a whole, and then was demolished during each concert’s finale. This installation, created for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for the museum’s opening in September 1995, mirrors portions of the set used for Waters’ July 21, 1990 all-star charity performance of The Wall at Potzdamer Platz in Berlin, Germany, commemorating the fall of the Berlin Wall. The text on the wall itself outlines the circumstances that inspired Roger Waters to create the album.

But there\\'s more to this story. During two other periods, the group expanded into a five-man lineup. A pair of albums was released by two different trio combinations, and another still with just Gilmour and Mason as official members. Then there was the one-off concert in the 2000s that found this often-battling quartet back together for one last time ... 1964-65 Syd Barrett / Bob Klose / Nick Mason / Roger Waters / Richard Wright Long before their initial rise to psychedelic fame with 1967\\'s \\'The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\\' to say nothing of David Gilmour\\'s arrival, Pink Floyd were a trippy five-piece featuring two guitarists: Syd Barrett and Bob Klose. In fact, that\\'s how Waters ended up on bass. Klose left after working on a pair of unreleased demos, \\'Lucy Leave\\' and \\'I\\'m a King Bee.\\' 1965-67 Syd Barrett / Nick Mason / Roger Waters / Richard Wright This lineup recorded two successful singles (\\'Arnold Layne\\' and \\'See Emily Play,\\' both of which reached the U.K. Top 20), and then Pink Floyd\\'s whacked-out debut , a No. 6 U.K. hit. But even as they began to pick up commercial stream, Mason, Waters and Wright began to find working with Barrett untenable as his use of mind-altering drugs escalated. They were forced to cancel an appearance at the National Jazz and Blues Festival, and a subsequent U.S. tour was marred by increasingly eccentric behavior. 1967-68 Syd Barrett / David Gilmour / Nick Mason / Roger Waters / Richard Wright Pink Floyd added Gilmour as a fifth member in December 1967, hoping to limit Barrett\\'s public exposure while he continued to work behind the scenes as a creative partner. But by early the next year, it was clear Barrett\\'s tenure in the band was ending. \\' A Saucerful of Secrets \\' would include a final Barrett original called \\'Jugband Blues,\\' and he would participate in a five-man take on Waters\\' darkly atmospheric \\'Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun.\\' 1968-1979 David Gilmour / Nick Mason / Roger Waters / Richard Wright Pink Floyd\\'s best-known lineup would release a string of career-making moments through the \\'70s, most notably \\'Meddle,\\' \\' The Dark Side of the Moon ,\\' \\'Wish You Were Here\\' and \\'Animals.\\' But by the time the group reassembled for the decade-ending opus \\'The Wall,\\' Wright found himself at odds with modern-era mastermind Waters. Wright would end up as a contract laborer on the subsequent tour, and he wouldn\\'t return to the lineup until after Waters\\' departure in the early \\'80s. 1979-1985 David Gilmour / Nick Mason / Roger Waters The bulk of this era was spent fighting over the rights to the Pink Floyd name, and the group managed only a single studio album, 1983\\'s Waters-dominated \\' The Final Cut .\\' By then, Pink Floyd had essentially been reduced to Waters\\' backing band. Lawsuits ensued when Waters chose to leave . Gilmour and Mason, it quickly became clear, wanted to continue forward as Pink Floyd. And so arguments in the press continued for years, even as the individual members began releasing solo albums. 1987-1990 David Gilmour / Nick Mason Finally cleared to move forward, Pink Floyd emerged with their first album in five years, now being led by Gilmour and Mason. Because of ongoing legal entanglements, however, Wright once again worked only as a paid sideman on the subsequent album and tour. \\' Momentary Lapse of Reason ,\\' which shot to No. 3, also saw the return of longtime Pink Floyd cover artist Storm Thorgerson, who hadn\\'t worked with the group since \\'Animals\\' in 1977. The legal issues weren\\'t over yet, though: Waters initially sued concert promoters over the use of the Pink Floyd name. 1990-95 David Gilmour / Nick Mason / Richard Wright As Pink Floyd returned for their second post-Roger Waters release, their time in court seemed to be over for good. Moreover, Wright was officially in tow again as a third member. He\\'d make his first songwriting contributions since 1975\\'s \\'Wish You Were Here\\' on\\xa0\\' The Division Bell ,\\' and become a regular touring partner with both Pink Floyd on the supporting tour and with Gilmour on his solo jaunts through 2008, when Wright succumbed to cancer. Pink Floyd\\'s 2014 album, \\'The Endless River,\\' grew out of these sessions. 2005 David Gilmour / Nick Mason / Roger Waters / Richard Wright On July 2, 2005, the \\'70s-era lineup reunited for the first time in nearly 25 years, brought together for one improbable night by the Live 8 benefit concert at London\\'s Hyde Park. The show, which was dedicated by Roger Waters in part to Syd Barrett (who died the following year), included \\'Speak to Me,\\' \\'Breathe\\' and \\'Money\\' from \\'Dark Side,\\' the title track from \\'Wish You Were Here\\' and \\' Comfortably Numb \\' from \\'The Wall.\\' Pink Floyd reportedly turned down millions for a reunion tour.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Forty years ago, on Nov. 30, 1979, the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd released its 11th studio album, “The Wall.” Featuring 26 tracks, two records and an operatic story line, the concept album would go on to become the No. 2 bestselling double album in history. But it would also mark the last time Pink Floyd’s core members – Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright – would record an album together. Years of touring and financial stress had taken their toll. The egomania of one member, Waters, during the recording of “The Wall” would be the tipping point. Tensions mount The unchecked egos of band members can often be difficult to rein in, and often lead to acrimony – to the point where the band breakup has almost become a cliché. Tensions among the four members of The Beatles – John Lennon and Paul McCartney, in particular – famously led to the band’s breakup in 1970 . Conflict between guitarist Johnny Marr and vocalist Morrissey triggered Marr’s decision to leave The Smiths . And let’s not forget The Eagles, which broke up on such bad terms that drummer and vocalist Don Henley said the band would reunite “ when hell freezes over .” By the time Pink Floyd started recording “The Wall” in January 1979, tensions had been simmering for years. “ The Dark Side of the Moon ,” released in 1973, had catapulted Pink Floyd to superstardom. But the band members struggled over how to build off the success of “Dark Side” and make another hit album. They had already fought among themselves when recording their follow-up albums, 1975’s “ Wish You Were Here ” and 1977’s “ Animals .” From left to right: Roger Waters, Nick Mason, David Gilmour and Richard Wright. Wikimedia Commons Roger Waters, the band’s bassist and co-lead singer, took charge for “Wish You Were Here.” He decided which tracks would appear and essentially dictated the album’s conceptual themes, which included alienation, a critique of the music industry and a tribute to former bandmate Syd Barrett, who had left the band in 1968 due to mental health struggles . In the process, Waters ended up cutting the songs, “Raving and Drooling” and “Gotta Be Crazy” against the wishes of guitarist and co-vocalist David Gilmour. “Dave was always clear that he wanted to do the other two songs,” Waters recalled . “He never quite copped what I was talking about. But Rick did and Nicky did, and he was outvoted, so we went on.” Perhaps feeling suffocated by Waters, Richard Wright and David Gilmour took a stab at solo albums in 1978, with Wright releasing “Wet Dream” and Gilmour debuting the self-titled “David Gilmour.” Reflecting on his first solo album, Gilmour said it “was important to me in terms of self-respect. At first I didn’t think my name was big enough to carry it. Being in a group for so long can be a bit claustrophobic, and I needed to step out from behind Floyd’s shadow.” The shadow of ‘The Wall’ “The Wall” would be the band’s next project – and, again, Waters asserted control. Waters was partly inspired by an infamous incident that took place during the “In the Flesh” tour, which promoted the album “Animals.” Annoyed by the sound of firecrackers – and feeling as if the crowd wasn’t listening to their music or lyrics – Waters spat on the audience . He later mused about building a wall between him and his fans. The seed for “The Wall” was planted. In July 1978, he presented a 90-minute demo to the rest of the band, proposing two concepts for the next album: “Bricks in the Wall” and “The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking.” The band members agreed to make an album focused on the first of the two. It would be about the struggles and isolation of rock stardom, and its central character would be named Pink Floyd. The name of the character belied the fact that this would largely be a one-man show. As musicologist Allan F. Moore observed , “Waters’ growing megalomania, much in evidence on ‘The Wall,’ became harder to handle.” The fact that the album’s central story was semi-autobiographical, based on Waters and former band member Syd Barrett, probably didn’t help matters. The motif of walls symbolized the defense mechanisms Waters had built up against those who might hurt him: parents, teachers, wives and lovers. Some lyrics dealt with the death of his father, others with infidelity. If David Gilmour had ideas for ways to contribute to Waters’ vision, they were barely incorporated. Waters did include fragments from demos associated with Gilmour’s solo projects. But in the end, Gilmour only received three co-writing credits – for “Run Like Hell,” “Young Lust” and “Comfortably Numb.” Drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright didn’t receive any at all. ‘Young Lust’ is one of only three songs on which David Gilmour received a writing credit. On the track “Mother,” Waters even brought in Toto drummer and session percussionist Jeff Porcaro to replace Mason. On Mason’s limited drumming abilities, Roger Waters recalled : “It’s got 5/4 bars in it. Nick, to his great credit, has no pretense about that, it was clear that he could not play it. He said ‘I can’t play that.’ Or maybe somebody said to him, ‘Nick, maybe you should get somebody else to play this because you’re struggling.’” The aftermath Today, “The Wall” is considered by many to be one of the best albums in rock history . But it marked the last time the four members of the band would record an album together. Keyboardist Richard Wright left, only to return later as a salaried sideman during Pink Floyd’s tours in 1980 and 1981. Pink Floyd – minus Wright – went on to record its 1983 album, “The Final Cut.” Waters eventually quit Pink Floyd in 1985 and sued members Gilmour and Mason in an attempt to stop them from using the band name, arguing that Pink Floyd was “ a spent force creatively .” Waters lost, and Gilmour and Mason went on to record three more albums under the name Pink Floyd: 1987’s “A Momentary Lapse of Reason,” 1994’s “The Division Bell” and 2014’s “ The Endless River .” None would match the critical or commercial success of “The Wall.” The making of “The Wall” reflects a common experience faced by many other rock bands: how creative tension and competing visions can deteriorate relations between band members. Luckily, Pink Floyd was able to keep it all together to record one final masterpiece. [ You’re smart and curious about the world. So are The Conversation’s authors and editors.

Fox View all posts by Jordan Runtagh July 7, 2016 Read little-known facts about Pink Floyd\\'s doomed genius Syd Barrett, including the last song he wrote for the band and how he spent his later days. Andrew Whittuck/Redferns/Getty As the spark that launched Pink Floyd into orbit, Syd Barrett left behind a small but unbelievably potent body of work. He was the principal songwriter behind the band’s debut – 1967 masterpiece The Piper at the Gates of Dawn – and a handful of strong early singles that helped define the psychedelic age. His creative genius was derailed by a drug-fueled psychological collapse, forcing his 1968 removal from the group he helped form. Though Barrett helmed Pink Floyd for barely two years out of their three-decade career, his specter haunted the band for the remainder of their existence and his presence is felt in some of their finest work. “I don’t think I’m easy to talk about,” Barrett confessed to Rolling Stone in 1971 , three years into his shaky solo career. “I’ve got a very irregular head. And I’m not anything that you think I am anyway.” Shortly after uttering this assessment, he was to abandon his musical career completely and withdraw from public life, allowing misconceptions and rumors to flourish. To some, he’s a guitar-wielding Icarus: a cautionary tale of fame, drugs and excess. To others, he’s the ultimate romantic ideal of a reclusive artist. Once he retreated into his private world, he left it to fans to solve the riddle that is Syd Barrett . By the end of his life, he had reverted to his birth name, Roger, and settled into his role as an amateur painter and local eccentric in his native Cambridge, England. Syd Barrett, the rock icon, died long before pancreatic cancer claimed his physical body on July 7th, 2006 . Ten years after his death, here are some little-known\\xa0facts about one of music’s most unique figures. 1. Barrett tried to join a religious sect before achieving success as a musician. In the summer of 1965, as Barrett took his first steps into the music world with an embryonic Pink Floyd, he also began using psychedelic drugs with friends in the Cambridge intellectual coterie. The introspection induced by LSD and other consciousness-expanding substances led many in his circle to convert to a sect of Sikhism known as Sant Mat (literally “Path of the Saints”). Dating back to 13th-century India, the religion follows a strict moral code and principles of abstinence. “A lot of people of Syd’s acquaintance were drawn quite hysterically, with massive enthusiasm, into it,” recalled David Gale, a close friend of Barrett’s, when interviewed by author Rob Chapman .

His biography, particularly focusing on his time with Pink Floyd, intertwines with the band’s evolution and its experimentation with progressive rock. Born in Kentford, England on 22 December 1942, Parry’s early life details are relatively obscure, but his musical journey took a significant turn when he joined Pink Floyd. His association with the band began in the early 1970s, a period when Pink Floyd was delving deeper into experimental and progressive rock, moving away from their psychedelic roots.

He was a founding member and lead singer of the 1960s pop band Amen Corner, which had four successive top-ten hits on the UK Singles Chart, including the number-one single “(If Paradise Is) Half as Nice” in 1969. After Amen Corner split in two in 1970, Fairweather Low led Dennis Bryon (drums), Blue Weaver (organ), Clive Taylor (bass) and Neil Jones (guitar) into a new band, Fair Weather. The band’s “Natural Sinner” peaked at No. 6 in the UK in July 1970. Fairweather Low has released four albums up to 1980 on A&M and Warner Bros. These spawned further single chart success with “Reggae Tune” (1974), and “Wide Eyed and Legless”, a No. 6 Christmas-time hit in 1975. In the late 1970s and 1980s he worked for numerous artists as a session...

Barrett was the band\\'s frontman and primary songwriter, known for his whimsical style of psychedelia , [1] English-accented singing, and stream-of-consciousness writing style. [4] As a guitarist, he was influential for his free-form playing and for employing effects such as dissonance , distortion , echo and feedback . Originally trained as a painter, Barrett was musically active for less than ten years. With Pink Floyd, he recorded the first four singles, their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967), portions of their second album A Saucerful of Secrets (1968), and several songs that were not released until years later. In April 1968, Barrett was ousted from the band amid speculation of mental illness and his use of psychedelic drugs . He began a brief solo career in 1969 with the single \" Octopus \", followed by albums The Madcap Laughs (1970) and Barrett (1970), recorded with the aid of three other members of Pink Floyd. [5] In 1972, Barrett left the music industry, retired from public life, and strictly guarded his privacy until his death. He continued painting and dedicated himself to gardening. Pink Floyd recorded several tributes and homages to him, including the 1975 song suite \" Shine On You Crazy Diamond \" and parts of the 1979 rock opera The Wall . In 1988, EMI released an album of unreleased tracks and outtakes, Opel , with Barrett\\'s approval. In 1996, Barrett was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd. He died of pancreatic cancer in 2006. Life and career Early years Roger Keith Barrett was born on 6 January 1946 [6] in Cambridge to a middle-class family living at 60 Glisson Road. [7] [8] He was the fourth of five children. [9] His father, Arthur Max Barrett , was a prominent pathologist [7] [10] [11] and was said to be related to Elizabeth Garrett Anderson through Max\\'s maternal grandmother Ellen Garrett. [10] [11] In 1951, his family moved to 183 Hills Road . [7] [8] Barrett played piano occasionally but usually preferred writing and drawing. He bought a ukulele aged 10, a banjo at 11 [12] and a Höfner acoustic guitar at 14. [13] [14] A year after he purchased his first acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar and built his own amplifier . [ citation needed ] He was a Scout with the 7th Cambridge troop and went on to be a patrol leader. [9] Barrett reportedly used the nickname Syd from the age of 14, derived from the name of an old Cambridge jazz bassist, [14] [15] Sid \"the Beat\" Barrett; Barrett changed the spelling to differentiate himself. [16] By another account, when Barrett was 13, his schoolmates nicknamed him Syd after he came to a field day at Abington Scout site wearing a flat cap instead of his scout beret, because \"Syd\" was a \"working-class\" name. [17] He used both names interchangeably for several years. His sister Rosemary said: \"He was never Syd at home. He would never have allowed it.\" [15] At one point at Morley Memorial Junior School, Barrett was taught by the mother of future Pink Floyd bassist Roger Waters . [18] Later, in 1957, he attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys [19] with Waters. [7] His father died of cancer on 11 December 1961, [14] [20] less than a month before Barrett\\'s 16th birthday. [21] On this date, Barrett left the entry in his diary blank. [14] By this time, his siblings had left home and his mother rented out rooms to lodgers. [20] [22] [23] Eager to help her son recover from his grief, Barrett\\'s mother encouraged the band in which he played, Geoff Mott and the Mottoes, a band which Barrett formed, [14] to perform in their front room. Waters and Barrett were childhood friends, and Waters often visited such gigs. [7] [14] [24] At one point, Waters organised a gig, a CND benefit at Friends Meeting House on 11 March 1962, [7] but shortly afterwards Geoff Mott joined the Boston Crabs, and the Mottoes broke up. [14] In September 1962, Barrett had taken a place at the art department of the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology , [25] where he met David Gilmour . [26] In late 1962 and early 1963, the Beatles made an impact on Barrett, and he began to play Beatles songs at parties and at picnics. In 1963, Barrett became a Rolling Stones fan and, with then-girlfriend Libby Gausden, saw them perform at a village hall in Cambridgeshire. [26] He would cite Jimmy Reed as an influence; however, he remarked that Bo Diddley was his greatest influence. [27] At this point, Barrett started writing songs; one friend recalls hearing \"Effervescing Elephant\" (later to be recorded on his solo album Barrett ). [28] Also around this time, Barrett and Gilmour occasionally played acoustic gigs together. [29] Barrett would refer to Gilmour as \"Fred\" in letters to girlfriends and relatives. [30] Barrett had played bass guitar with Those Without in mid-1963 [29] [31] and bass and guitar with the Hollerin\\' Blues the next summer. [29] In 1964, Barrett and Gausden saw Bob Dylan perform. [26] After this performance, Barrett was inspired to write \" Bob Dylan Blues \". [32] Barrett, now thinking about his future, [29] decided to apply for Camberwell College of Arts in London. [33] He enrolled in the college in the summer of 1964 to study painting. [29] [34] Pink Floyd years (1965–1968) Main article: Pink Floyd §\\xa01963–1967: Early years Starting in 1964, the band that would become Pink Floyd evolved through various line-up and name changes including the Abdabs, [35] [36] the Screaming Abdabs, [36] Sigma 6 [36] [37] and the Meggadeaths. [36] In 1965, Barrett joined them as the Tea Set [36] [38] (sometimes spelled T-Set). [39] When they found themselves playing a concert with another band of the same name, Barrett came up with the Pink Floyd Sound (also known as the Pink Floyd Blues Band, [39] later the Pink Floyd). [nb 1] During 1965, they went into a studio for the first time, when a friend of Richard Wright \\'s gave the band free time to record. [nb 2] [38] During this summer Barrett had his first LSD trip in the garden of friend Dave Gale, [46] [47] with Ian Moore and Storm Thorgerson . [nb 3] [46] During one trip, Barrett and another friend, Paul Charrier, ended up naked in the bath, reciting: \"No rules, no rules\". [48] That summer, as a result of the continued drug use, the band became absorbed in Sant Mat , a Sikh sect. Storm Thorgerson (then living on Earlham Street ) and Barrett went to a London hotel to meet the sect\\'s guru ; Thorgerson managed to join the sect; Barrett, however, was deemed too young to join. Thorgerson saw this as a deeply important event in Barrett\\'s life, as he was extremely upset by the rejection. While living near his friends, Barrett decided to write more songs (\" Bike \" was written around this time). [42] London underground, Blackhill Enterprises and gigs Main article: Blackhill Enterprises While Pink Floyd began by playing cover versions of American R&B songs, [49] by 1966 they had carved out their own style of improvised rock and roll, [50] [51] which drew as much from improvised jazz . [52] After Bob Klose departed from the band, the band\\'s direction changed. However, the change was not instantaneous, [nb 4] with more improvising on the guitars and keyboards. [42] Drummer Nick Mason reflected, \"It always felt to me that most of the ideas were emanating from Syd at the time.\" [nb 5] [42] At this time, Barrett\\'s reading reputedly included Grimm \\'s Fairy Tales , Tolkien \\'s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings , and The I-Ching . During this period, Barrett wrote most of the songs for Pink Floyd\\'s first album , and also songs that would later appear on his solo albums. [55] In 1966, a new rock concert venue, the UFO , [57] opened in London and quickly became a haven for British psychedelic music . Pink Floyd, the house band, [53] [57] [58] [59] was its most popular attraction and after making appearances at the rival Roundhouse , [59] [60] [61] became the most popular musical group of the London underground psychedelic music scene. [13] By the end of 1966, Pink Floyd had gained a reliable management team in Andrew King and Peter Jenner . [62] Towards the end of October 1966, Pink Floyd, with King and Jenner, set up Blackhill Enterprises , to manage the group\\'s finances. Blackhill was staffed by lodgers Jenner found in his Edbrooke Road house, and among others, Barrett\\'s flatmate, Peter Wynne Wilson (who became road manager; however, since he had more experience in lighting, he was also lighting assistant). [63] King and Jenner wanted to prepare some demo recordings for a possible record deal, so at the end of October, they booked a session at Thompson Private Recording Studio, [59] in Hemel Hempstead . [nb 6] [63] King said of the demos: \"That was the first time I realised they were going to write all their own material, Syd just turned into a songwriter, it seemed like overnight.\" [64] King and Jenner befriended American expatriate Joe Boyd , the promoter of the UFO Club, who was making a name for himself as one of the more important entrepreneurs on the British music scene. The newly hired booking agent, Bryan Morrison , and Boyd had proposed sending in better quality recordings. From Morrison\\'s agency the band played a gig outside London for the first time. [65] In November, the band performed the first (of many) strangely named concerts: Philadelic Music for Simian Hominids, a multimedia event arranged by the group\\'s former landlord, Mike Leonard, at Hornsey College of Art . [59] [65] They performed at the Free School [66] for the following two weeks, before performing at the Psychodelphia Versus Ian Smith event at the Roundhouse in December, arranged by the Majority Rule for Rhodesia Campaign, and an Oxfam benefit at the Albert Hall [59] (the band\\'s biggest venue up to this point). [65] Tonite Let\\'s All Make Love in London Main articles: Tonite Let’s All Make Love in London (film) and Tonite Lets All Make Love in London At the beginning of 1967, Barrett was dating Jenny Spires. However, unknown to Barrett, Spires had an affair with Peter Whitehead . Spires convinced Whitehead (who thought the band sounded like \"bad Schoenberg \") to use Pink Floyd in a film about the swinging London scene. [67] At the cost of £80 (equivalent to £1,545 in 2021 [68] ), in January, Whitehead took the band into John Wood \\'s Sound Techniques in Chelsea, [69] with the promoter Joe Boyd. [67] They recorded a 16-minute version of \"Interstellar Overdrive\" and another composition, \"Nick\\'s Boogie\". [67] [69] Whitehead had filmed this recording, which was used in the film Tonite Let\\'s All Make Love in London [69] and later on the video release of London \\'66–\\'67 . [67] [69] Whitehead later said the band \"were just completely welded together, just like a jazz group\". [67] Syd Barrett\\'s light gray \"Mirrored\" Fender Esquire at the Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains exhibition in Toronto. The Piper at the Gates of Dawn Main article: The Piper at the Gates of Dawn Boyd attempted to sign the band with Polydor Records . [56] [70] However, Morrison had convinced King and Jenner to try to start a bidding war between Polydor and EMI . [70] In late January, Boyd produced a recording session for the group, [56] [62] with them returning to Sound Techniques in Chelsea again. [nb 7] [56] [72] After the bidding war idea was finished, Pink Floyd signed with EMI. Unusual for the time, the deal included recording an album, which meant the band had unlimited studio time at EMI Studios in return for a smaller royalty percentage. The band then attempted to re-record \"Arnold Layne\", but the Boyd version from January was released instead. [71] The band\\'s first studio album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn , was recorded intermittently between February and July 1967 in Studio 3 at Abbey Road Studios , and produced by former Beatles engineer Norman Smith . [73] By the time the album was released on 4 August, \"Arnold Layne\" (which was released months earlier, on 11 March) had reached number 20 on the British singles charts, [74] despite being banned by Radio London, [71] [75] and the follow-up single, \" See Emily Play \", had peaked at number 5. [74] The album was successful in the UK, hitting number 6 on the British album charts. [74] Their first three singles (including their third, \" Apples and Oranges \"), were written by Barrett, who also was the principal visionary/author of their critically acclaimed 1967 debut album. Of the eleven songs on Piper , Barrett wrote eight and co-wrote another two. [76] Health problems Through late 1967 and early 1968, Barrett became increasingly erratic, partly as a consequence of his heavy use of psychedelic drugs such as LSD . [13] Once described as joyful, friendly, and extroverted, he became increasingly depressed and withdrawn, and experienced hallucinations, disorganised speech, memory lapses, intense mood swings and periods of catatonia . [9] Although the changes began gradually, he went missing for a long weekend and, according to several friends, including Wright, came back \"a completely different person\". [9] One of the striking features of his change was the development of a blank, dead-eyed stare. Barrett did not recognise friends, and often did not know where he was. While Pink Floyd were recording \"See Emily Play\" at the Sound Techniques studio, Gilmour stopped by on his return visit from Europe to say hello to Barrett. According to Gilmour, he \"just looked straight through me, barely acknowledged me that I was there\". [77] Boyd encountered Barrett and the rest of the Floyd at the UFO Club in mid-1967, which he described in his memoir: \"I had exchanged pleasantries with the first three when Syd emerged from the crush. His sparkling eyes had always been his most attractive feature but that night they were vacant, as if someone had reached inside his head and turned off a switch. During their set he hardly sang, standing motionless for long passages, arms by his sides, staring into space.\" [78] On a tour of Los Angeles, Barrett is said to have exclaimed, \"Gee, it sure is nice to be in Las Vegas!\" [9] Many reports described him on stage, strumming one chord through the entire concert, or not playing at all. [79] At a show in Santa Monica, Barrett slowly detuned his guitar. [80] Interviewed on The Pat Boone in Hollywood television programme during the tour, Barrett replied with a \"blank and totally mute stare\"; according to Mason, \"Syd wasn\\'t into moving his lips that day.\" Barrett exhibited similar behaviour during the band\\'s first appearance on Dick Clark \\'s television show American Bandstand . [81] Surviving footage of this appearance shows Barrett miming his parts competently; [82] however, during a group interview afterwards, Barrett gave terse answers. During their appearance on the Perry Como show, Rick Wright had to mime all the vocals on \"Matilda Mother\" because of Barrett\\'s condition. [83] During this time, Barrett would often forget to bring his guitar to sessions, damage equipment and was occasionally unable to hold his plectrum. [84] Before a performance in late 1967, Barrett reportedly crushed Mandrax tranquilliser tablets and a tube of Brylcreem into his hair, which melted down his face under the heat of the stage lighting, [85] making him look like \"a guttered candle\". [86] Mason disputed the Mandrax portion of this story, saying that \"Syd would never waste good mandies\". [87] Departure from Pink Floyd During Pink Floyd\\'s UK tour with Jimi Hendrix in November 1967, guitarist David O\\'List from The Nice (who were fifth on the bill) [88] substituted for Barrett on several occasions when he was unable to perform or failed to appear. [89] Around Christmas, Pink Floyd asked Gilmour to join as a second guitarist to cover for Barrett. For a handful of shows, Gilmour played and sang while Barrett wandered around on stage, occasionally joining the performance. The other band members grew tired of Barrett\\'s antics and, on 26 January 1968, when Waters was driving on the way to a show at Southampton University , they elected not to pick Barrett up. One person in the car said, \"Shall we pick Syd up?\" and another said, \"Let\\'s not bother.\" [90] [91] [92] [93] As Barrett had written the bulk of the band\\'s material, the plan was to retain him as a non-touring member, as the Beach Boys had done with Brian Wilson , but this proved impractical. [92] [94] [95] According to Waters, Barrett came to what was to be their last practice session with a new song he had dubbed \" Have You Got It Yet? \" The song seemed simple when he first presented it, but it soon became impossibly difficult to learn; the band eventually realised that Barrett was changing the arrangement as they played, [92] [95] and that Barrett was playing a joke on them. [96] According to David Gilmour, it \"was really just a twelve-bar, but the responses were always in the wrong places according to Syd. Some parts of his brain were perfectly intact—his sense of humour being one of them.\" [97] Waters called it \"a real act of mad genius\". [92] [95] Of the songs Barrett wrote for Pink Floyd after The Piper at the Gates of Dawn , only \" Jugband Blues \" was included on their album, A Saucerful of Secrets (1968) . \"Apples and Oranges\" became an unsuccessful single, while \" Scream Thy Last Scream \", \" Vegetable Man \" and the instrumental \"In The Beechwoods\" remained unreleased until 2016 in The Early Years 1965–1972 box set, as the former two were deemed too dark and unsettling. [9] Another instrumental mislabelled \" Sunshine \" by bootleggers and Waters composition \" One in a Million \" remain unreleased (the latter circulates only on concert recordings.) Barrett played guitar on the Saucerful of Secrets tracks \" Remember a Day \" and \" Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun \". [98] Feeling guilty, the members of Pink Floyd did not tell Barrett that he was no longer in the band. According to Wright, who lived with Barrett at the time, he told Barrett he was going out to buy cigarettes when leaving to play a show. He would return hours later to find Barrett in the same position, sometimes with a cigarette burned completely down between his fingers. The incident was later referenced in the film Pink Floyd – The Wall . Emerging from catatonia and unaware that a long period had elapsed, Barrett would ask, \"Have you got the cigarettes?\" [9] Barrett spent time outside the recording studio, in the reception area, [99] waiting to be invited in. He also came to a few performances and glared at Gilmour. [98] On 6 April 1968, Pink Floyd officially announced that Barrett was no longer a member, [99] the same day their contract with Blackhill Enterprises was terminated. Considering him the band\\'s musical leader, Blackhill Enterprises retained Barrett. [9] [92] [100] Solo years (1968–1972) After leaving Pink Floyd, Barrett was out of the public eye for a year. [101] In 1969, at the behest of EMI and Harvest Records , he embarked on a brief solo career, releasing two solo albums, The Madcap Laughs and Barrett (both 1970), and a single, \" Octopus \". Some songs, \" Terrapin \", \"Maisie\" and \" Bob Dylan Blues \", reflected Barrett\\'s early interest in the blues. [102] The Madcap Laughs (1970) Main article: The Madcap Laughs After Barrett left Pink Floyd, Jenner quit as their manager. He led Barrett into EMI Studios to record tracks [103] in May that were released on Barrett\\'s first solo album, The Madcap Laughs . However, Jenner said: \"I had seriously underestimated the difficulties of working with him.\" [104] By the sessions of June and July, most of the tracks were in better shape; however, shortly after the July sessions, Barrett broke up with his girlfriend Lindsay Corner and went on a drive around Britain, ending up in psychiatric care in Cambridge. [105] During New Year 1969, Barrett, somewhat recovered, had taken up tenancy in a flat on Egerton Gardens , South Kensington , London, with the postmodernist artist Duggie Fields . [105] [106] Barrett\\'s flat was so close to Gilmour\\'s that Gilmour could look right into Barrett\\'s kitchen. [105] Syd Barrett\\'s Danelectro 59 DC at the Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains exhibition in Toronto. June 25, 2023. Deciding to return to music, Barrett contacted EMI and was passed to Malcolm Jones, the head of EMI\\'s new prog rock label, Harvest . [103] After Norman Smith [107] and Jenner declined to produce Barrett\\'s record, [107] Jones produced it. [105] [107] Barrett wanted to recover the recordings made with Jenner; several of the tracks were improved upon. [108] The sessions with Jones started in April 1969 at EMI Studios. After the first, Barrett brought in friends to help: the Humble Pie drummer Jerry Shirley , and Willie Wilson, the drummer of Gilmour\\'s old band Jokers Wild . For the sessions, Gilmour played bass. Jones said that communicating with Barrett was difficult: \"It was a case of following him, not playing with him. They were seeing and then playing so they were always a note behind.\" [105] A few tracks on the album feature overdubs by members of Soft Machine . [60] During this time, Barrett also played guitar on the sessions for the Soft Machine founder Kevin Ayers \\' debut LP Joy of a Toy , [109] although his performance on \"Religious Experience\", later titled \" Singing a Song in the Morning \", was not released until the album was reissued in 2003. [60] [110] At one point, Barrett told his flatmate that he was going for an afternoon drive, but followed Pink Floyd to Ibiza; according to legend, he skipped check-ins and customs, ran onto the runway and attempted to flag down a jet. One of his friends, J. Ryan Eaves, the bass player for the short-lived but influential Manchester band York\\'s Ensemble, spotted him on a beach wearing dirty clothes and with a carrier bag full of money. During the trip, Barrett asked Gilmour for help in the recording sessions. [105] After two of the Gilmour/Waters-produced sessions, [111] they remade one track from the Soft Machine overdubs and recorded three tracks. These sessions came to a minor halt when Gilmour and Waters were mixing Pink Floyd\\'s newly recorded album, Ummagumma . However, through the end of July, they managed to record three more tracks. The problem with the recording was that the songs were recorded as Barrett played them \"live\" in studio. On the released versions a number of them have false starts and commentaries from Barrett. [105] Despite the track being closer to complete and better produced, Gilmour and Waters left the Jones-produced track \"Opel\" off Madcap . [112] Gilmour later said of the sessions for The Madcap Laughs : [The sessions] were pretty tortuous and very rushed. We had very little time, particularly with The Madcap Laughs . Syd was very difficult, we got that very frustrated feeling: Look, it\\'s your fucking career, mate. Why don\\'t you get your finger out and do something? The guy was in trouble, and was a close friend for many years before then, so it really was the least one could do. [113] Upon the album\\'s release in January 1970, Jones was shocked by the substandard musicianship on the songs produced by Gilmour and Waters: \"I felt angry. It\\'s like dirty linen in public and very unnecessary and unkind.\" Gilmour said: \"Perhaps we were trying to show what Syd was really like. But perhaps we were trying to punish him.\" Waters was more positive: \"Syd is a genius.\" [114] Barrett said: \"It\\'s quite nice but I\\'d be very surprised if it did anything if I were to drop dead. I don\\'t think it would stand as my last statement.\" [114] Barrett (1970) Main article: Barrett (album) The second album, Barrett , was recorded more sporadically, [115] the sessions taking place between February and July 1970. [114] [116] The album was produced by Gilmour, [114] [117] and featured Gilmour on bass guitar, Richard Wright on keyboard and Humble Pie drummer Jerry Shirley . The first two songs attempted were for Barrett to play and/or sing to an existing backing track. However, Gilmour thought they were losing the \"Barrett-ness\". One track (\"Rats\") was originally recorded with Barrett on his own. That would later be overdubbed by musicians, despite the changing tempos. Shirley said of Barrett\\'s playing: \"He would never play the same tune twice. Sometimes Syd couldn\\'t play anything that made sense; other times what he\\'d play was absolute magic.\" At times Barrett, who experienced synaesthesia , [9] would say: \"Perhaps we could make the middle darker and maybe the end a bit middle afternoonish. At the moment it\\'s too windy and icy.\" [114] In a 1970 interview reprinted in 1975, Barrett mentions listening to Taj Mahal and Captain Beefheart . [118] These sessions were happening while Pink Floyd had just begun to work on Atom Heart Mother . On various occasions, Barrett went to \"spy\" on the band as they recorded their album. [114] Wright said of the Barrett sessions: Doing Syd\\'s record was interesting, but extremely difficult. Dave [Gilmour] and Roger did the first one ( The Madcap Laughs ) and Dave and myself did the second one. But by then it was just trying to help Syd any way we could, rather than worrying about getting the best guitar sound. You could forget about that! It was just going into the studio and trying to get him to sing. [119] Performances Despite the numerous recording dates for his solo albums, Barrett undertook very little musical activity between 1968 and 1972 outside the studio. On 24 February 1970, he appeared on John Peel \\'s BBC radio programme Top Gear [114] [120] playing five songs—only one of which had been previously released. Three would be re-recorded for the Barrett album, while the song \"Two of a Kind\" was a one-off performance (possibly written by Richard Wright). [nb 8] Barrett was accompanied on this session by Gilmour and Shirley who played bass and percussion, [114] respectively. [nb 9] Gilmour and Shirley also backed Barrett for his one and only live concert during this period. [117] The gig took place on 6 June 1970 at the Olympia Exhibition Hall as part of a Music and Fashion Festival . [123] The trio performed four songs, [117] \"Terrapin\", \"Gigolo Aunt\", \"Effervescing Elephant\" and \"Octopus\". Poor mixing left the vocals barely audible until part-way through the last number. [123] At the end of the fourth song, Barrett unexpectedly but politely put down his guitar and walked off the stage. [117] The performance has been bootlegged. [123] [124] Barrett made one last appearance on BBC Radio , recording three songs at their studios on 16 February 1971. [nb 10] All three came from the Barrett album. After this session, he took a hiatus from his music career that lasted more than a year, although in an extensive interview with Mick Rock and Rolling Stone in December, he discussed himself at length, showed off his new 12-string guitar, talked about touring with Jimi Hendrix and stated that he was frustrated in terms of his musical work because of his inability to find anyone good to play with. [125] Later years (1972–2006) Stars and final recordings See also: Stars (British band) In February 1972, after a few guest spots in Cambridge with ex- Pink Fairies member Twink on drums and Jack Monck on bass using the name The Last Minute Put Together Boogie Band (backing visiting blues musician Eddie \"Guitar\" Burns and also featuring Henry Cow guitarist Fred Frith ), the trio formed a short-lived band called Stars . [126] Though they were initially well received at gigs in the Dandelion coffee bar and the town\\'s Market Square, one of their gigs at the Corn Exchange in Cambridge [127] with MC5 proved to be disastrous. [128] A few days after this final show, Twink recalled that Barrett stopped him on the street, showed him a scathing review of the gig they had played, and quit on the spot, [128] despite having played at least one subsequent gig at the same venue supporting Nektar . [87] Free from his EMI contract on 9 May 1972, Barrett signed a document that ended his association with Pink Floyd, and any financial interest in future recordings. [129] He attended an informal jazz and poetry performance by Pete Brown and former Cream bassist Jack Bruce in October 1973. Brown arrived at the show late, and saw that Bruce was already onstage, along with \"a guitarist I vaguely recognised\", playing the Horace Silver tune \" Doodlin\\' \". Later in the show, Brown read out a poem, which he dedicated to Syd, because, \"he\\'s here in Cambridge, and he\\'s one of the best songwriters in the country\" when, to his surprise, the guitar player from earlier in the show stood up and said, \"No I\\'m not\". [130] By the end of 1973, Barrett had returned to live in London, staying at various hotels and, in December of that year, settling in at Chelsea Cloisters. He had little contact with others, apart from his regular visits to his management\\'s offices to collect his royalties, [126] and the occasional visit from his sister Rosemary. In August 1974, [126] Jenner persuaded Barrett to return to Abbey Road Studios in hope of recording another album. According to John Leckie , who engineered these sessions, even at this point Syd still \"looked like he did when he was younger\\xa0... long haired\". [131] The sessions lasted three days and consisted of blues rhythm tracks with tentative and disjointed guitar overdubs. Barrett recorded eleven tracks, the only one of which to be titled was \"If You Go, Don\\'t Be Slow\". Once again, Barrett withdrew from the music industry, but this time for good. He sold the rights to his solo albums back to the record label and moved into a London hotel. During this period, several attempts to employ him as a record producer (including one by Jamie Reid on behalf of the Sex Pistols , and another by the Damned , who wanted him to produce their second album ) were fruitless. [132] [133] Wish You Were Here sessions Barrett visiting Abbey Road Studios on 5 June 1975 Barrett visited the members of Pink Floyd in 1975 during the recording sessions for their ninth album, Wish You Were Here . He attended the Abbey Road session unannounced, and watched the band working on the final mix of \" Shine On You Crazy Diamond \"—a song about him. Barrett, then 29, was overweight and had shaved off all of his hair (including his eyebrows), and his former bandmates did not initially recognise him. Barrett spent part of the session brushing his teeth. [134] [135] Waters asked him what he thought of the song to which Barrett responded \"sounds a bit old\". [135] He is reported to have briefly attended the reception for Gilmour\\'s wedding to Ginger that immediately followed the recording sessions, but Gilmour said he had no recollection of this. [136] A few years later, Waters saw Barrett in the department store Harrods ; [137] [ verification needed ] Barrett ran away, dropping his bags, which Waters said were filled with candy. [128] Withdrawal to Cambridge In 1978, when Barrett\\'s money ran out, he moved back to Cambridge to live with his mother. He returned to live in London for a few weeks in 1982, but soon returned to Cambridge permanently. Barrett walked the 50 miles (80\\xa0km) from London to Cambridge. [138] Until his death, he received royalties from his work with Pink Floyd; Gilmour said, \"I made sure the money got to him.\" [139] In 1996, Barrett was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd. He did not attend the ceremony. [140] According to the biographer and journalist Tim Willis, Barrett, who had reverted to using his birth name Roger, continued to live in his late mother\\'s semi-detached home, and returned to painting, creating large abstract canvases. He was also an avid gardener. His main point of contact with the outside world was his sister, Rosemary, who lived nearby. He was reclusive, and his physical health declined, as he had stomach ulcers and type 2 diabetes . [141] Although Barrett had not appeared or spoken in public since the mid-1970s, reporters and fans travelled to Cambridge seeking him, despite public appeals from his family to stop. [142] Apparently, Barrett did not like being reminded about his musical career and the other members of Pink Floyd had no direct contact with him. However, he did visit his sister\\'s house in November 2001 to watch the BBC Omnibus documentary made about him ; reportedly he found some of it \"a bit noisy\", enjoyed seeing Mike Leonard again, calling him his \"teacher\", and enjoyed hearing \" See Emily Play \". [143] Barrett made a final public acknowledgement of his musical past in 2002, his first since the 1970s, when he autographed 320 copies of Psychedelic Renegades, a book by the photographer Mick Rock which contained a number of photos of Barrett. Rock had conducted Barrett\\'s final interview in 1971 before his retirement from the music industry, and Barrett visited Rock in London several times for tea and conversation in 1978. [144] They had not spoken in more than 20 years when Rock approached Barrett to autograph his book, and Barrett uncharacteristically agreed. Having reverted to his birth name, he autographed the book \"Barrett\". [144] Death and tributes Barrett died at home in Cambridge on 7 July 2006 [23] aged 60, from pancreatic cancer . [145] [146] His death was reported a week later on 12 July. [147] He was cremated at a funeral held at Cambridge Crematorium on 18 July 2006; no Pink Floyd members attended. In a statement, Wright said: \"The band are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett\\'s death. Syd was the guiding light of the early band lineup and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire.\" [147] Gilmour said: \"Do find time to play some of Syd\\'s songs and to remember him as the madcap genius who made us all smile with his wonderfully eccentric songs about bikes, gnomes, and scarecrows. His career was painfully short, yet he touched more people than he could ever know.\" [148] NME produced a tribute issue to Barrett a week later with a photo of him on the cover. In an interview with The Sunday Times , Barrett\\'s sister, Rosemary Breen, said that he had written an unpublished book about the history of art. [149] According to local newspapers, Barrett left approximately £1.7\\xa0million to his four siblings, [150] largely acquired from royalties from Pink Floyd compilations and live recordings featuring Barrett\\'s songs. [139] A tribute concert, \"Madcap\\'s Last Laugh\", [151] was held at the Barbican Centre , London, on 10 May 2007 with Barrett\\'s bandmates and Robyn Hitchcock , Captain Sensible , Damon Albarn , Chrissie Hynde and Kevin Ayers . [152] Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed the Barrett compositions \" Bike \" and \"Arnold Layne\", and Waters performed a solo version of his song \"Flickering Flame\". [153] In 2006, Barrett\\'s home in St. Margaret\\'s Square, Cambridge, was put on the market and attracted considerable interest. [154] After over 100 showings, many to fans, it was sold to a French couple who knew nothing about Barrett. [155] On 28 November 2006, Barrett\\'s other possessions were sold at an auction at Cheffins auction house in Cambridge, raising £120,000 for charity. [156] Items sold included paintings, scrapbooks and everyday items that Barrett had decorated. [157] His small, paperback copy of cambridge 2005 [ sic ] has the handwritten inscription \"RB \\'06\" inside the front cover. [ clarification needed ] A series of events called The City Wakes was held in Cambridge in October 2008 to celebrate Barrett\\'s life, art, and music. Breen supported this, the first series of official events in memory of her brother. [158] After the festival\\'s success, arts charity Escape Artists announced plans to create a centre in Cambridge, using art to help people with mental health problems. [159] A memorial bench was placed in the Botanic Gardens in Cambridge and a more prominent tribute was planned in the city. [160] Legacy Compilations In 1988, EMI Records (after constant pressure from Malcolm Jones) [161] made an album of Barrett\\'s studio out-takes and unreleased material recorded from 1968 to 1970 under the title Opel . [162] The disc was originally set to include the unreleased Barrett Pink Floyd songs \"Scream Thy Last Scream\" and \"Vegetable Man\", which had been remixed for the album by Jones, [161] but the band pulled the two songs [163] before Opel was finalised. [164] In 1993 EMI issued another release, Crazy Diamond , a boxed set of all three albums, each with further out-takes from his solo sessions that illustrated Barrett\\'s inability or refusal to play a song the same way twice. [165] EMI also released The Best of Syd Barrett: Wouldn\\'t You Miss Me? in the UK on 16 April 2001 and in the US on 11 September 2001. [166] This was the first time his song \" Bob Dylan Blues \" was officially released, taken from a demo tape that Gilmour had kept after an early 1970s session. [166] Gilmour kept the tape, which also contains the unreleased \"Living Alone\" from the Barrett sessions. [167] In October 2010 Harvest/EMI and Capitol Records released An Introduction to Syd Barrett —a collection of both his Pink Floyd and remastered solo work. [168] The 2010 compilation An Introduction to Syd Barrett includes the downloadable bonus track \"Rhamadan\", a 20-minute track recorded at one of Syd\\'s earliest solo sessions, in May 1968. In 2011, it was announced that a vinyl double album version would be issued for Record Store Day . [169] [170] Bootleg editions of Barrett\\'s live and solo material exist. [171] [172] For years the \"off air\" recordings of the BBC sessions with Barrett\\'s Pink Floyd circulated, until an engineer who had taken a tape of the early Pink Floyd gave it back to the BBC—which played it during a tribute to John Peel on their website. During this tribute, the first Peel programme ( Top Gear ) was aired in its entirety. This show featured the 1967 live versions of \" Flaming \", \" Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun \", and a brief 90-second snippet of the instrumental \" Reaction in G \". In 2012, engineer Andy Jackson said he had found \"a huge box of assorted tapes\", in Mason\\'s possession, containing versions of R&B songs that (the Barrett-era) Pink Floyd played in their early years. [173] Creative impact Barrett\\'s first acoustic guitar Barrett\\'s Mirrored Fender Esquire Barrett wrote most of Pink Floyd\\'s early material, and their producer, Norman Smith compared him favourably with John Lennon in his memoir: \"Syd Barrett could write like John. I\\'ve said it before. He wasn\\'t quite as good as John, and I am talking about a Syd on top form with \\'See Emily Play\\'. But he would have developed. Definitely! In time he would have got even better.\" [174] Jimmy Page never saw Barrett play with the Floyd, but was a fan of the early group\\'s music, telling an interviewer, \"Syd Barrett\\'s writing with the early Pink Floyd was inspirational. Nothing sounded like Barrett before Pink Floyd\\'s first album. There were so many ideas and so many positive statements. You can really feel the genius there, and it was tragic that he fell apart. Both he and Jimi Hendrix had a futuristic vision in a sense.\" [175] According to critic Steven Hyden , even after Barrett left the band, Barrett\\'s spirit \"haunted\" their records, and their most popular work \"drew on the power of what Barrett signified\". [176] Barrett was an innovative guitarist, using extended techniques and exploring the musical and sonic possibilities of dissonance , distortion , feedback , the echo machine , tapes and other effects; his experimentation was partly inspired by free improvisation guitarist Keith Rowe of the group AMM , active at the time in London. [177] Rowe would lay the guitar flat on a table and, among other things, would run ball bearings, metal rulers, coins, or knives along the strings. [178] AMM and Pink Floyd played several gigs together from early 1966 to early 1967, and Barrett even attended the recording session for the group\\'s debut album, \"AMMMusic\", in June 1966. [179] One of Barrett\\'s trademarks was playing his guitar through an old echo box while sliding a Zippo lighter up and down the fret-board to create the mysterious, otherworldly sounds that became associated with the group. Barrett was known to have used Binson delay units to achieve his trademark echo sounds. Daevid Allen , founder member of Soft Machine and Gong , cited Barrett\\'s use of slide guitar with echo as a key inspiration for his own \"glissando guitar\" style. [180] Barrett\\'s recordings both with Pink Floyd and in later solo albums were delivered with a strongly British-accented vocal delivery, specifically that of southern England. He was described by Guardian writer Nick Kent as having a \"quintessential English style of vocal projection\". [181] David Bowie said that Barrett, along with Anthony Newley , was the first person he had heard sing rock or pop music with a British accent. [182] Barrett\\'s free-form sequences of \"sonic carpets\" pioneered a new way to play the rock guitar. [183] He played several different guitars during his tenure, including an old Harmony hollowbody electric, a Harmony acoustic, a Fender acoustic, a single-coil Danelectro 59 DC , [184] several different Fender Telecasters and a white Fender Stratocaster in late 1967. A silver Fender Esquire with mirrored discs glued to the body [185] was the guitar he was most often associated with and the guitar he \"felt most close to\". [125] The mirrored Esquire was traded for a black Telecaster Custom, in 1968. Its whereabouts are currently unknown. [186] Influence Many artists have acknowledged Barrett\\'s influence on their work. Paul McCartney , Pete Townshend , [187] Blur , [188] [189] [190] Kevin Ayers , [191] Gong , [191] Marc Bolan , [189] [192] Tangerine Dream , [193] Genesis P-Orridge , [194] [195] Julian Cope , [196] Pere Ubu , [197] Jeff Mangum , [198] The Olivia Tremor Control , [199] The Flaming Lips , [200] Animal Collective , [201] John Maus , [202] Paul Weller , Roger Miller , East Bay Ray , Cedric Bixler-Zavala , [203] and David Bowie [189] [192] were inspired by Barrett; Jimmy Page , Brian Eno , [204] Sex Pistols , [205] and The Damned [132] [206] all expressed interest in working with him at some point during the 1970s. Bowie recorded a cover of \" See Emily Play \" on his 1973 album Pin Ups . [207] The track \"Grass\", from XTC \\'s album Skylarking was influenced when Andy Partridge let fellow band member Colin Moulding borrow his Barrett records. Robyn Hitchcock \\'s career was dedicated to being Barrett-esque; he even played \"Dominoes\" for the 2001 BBC documentary The Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett Story . [196] Barrett also had an influence on alternative and punk music in general. According to critic John Harris : To understand his place in modern music you probably have to first go back to punk rock and its misguided attempt to kick aside what remained of the psychedelic 1960s. Given that the Clash and Sex Pistols had made brutal social commentary obligatory, there seemed little room for any of the creative exotica that had defined the Love Decade—until, slowly but surely, singing about dead-end lives and dole queues began to pall, and at least some of the previous generation were rehabilitated. Barrett was the best example: having crashed out of Pink Floyd before the advent of indulgent \"progressive\" rock , and succumbed to a fate that appealed to the punk generation\\'s nihilism, he underwent a revival. [208] Barrett\\'s decline had a profound effect on Waters\\' songwriting, and the theme of mental illness permeated the later Pink Floyd albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975) and The Wall (1979). [209] The reference to a \"steel rail\" in the song \" Wish You Were Here \" [210] —\"can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?\"—references a recurring theme in Barrett\\'s song \"If It\\'s In You\" from The Madcap Laughs . The song suite \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" from Wish You Were Here is also a tribute to Barrett. [211] In 1987, an album of Barrett cover songs called Beyond the Wildwood was released. The album was a collection of cover songs from Barrett\\'s tenure with Pink Floyd and from his solo career. Artists appearing were UK and US indie bands including The Shamen , Opal , The Soup Dragons , and Plasticland . [212] Other artists who have written tributes to Barrett include his contemporary Kevin Ayers , who wrote \"O Wot a Dream\" in his honour (Barrett provided guitar to an early version of Ayers\\' song \"Religious Experience: Singing a Song in the Morning\"). [60] [110] Robyn Hitchcock has covered many of his songs live and on record and paid homage to his forebear with the song \"(Feels Like) 1974\". Phish covered \"Bike\", \"No Good Trying\", \"Love You\", \"Baby Lemonade\" and \"Terrapin\". The Television Personalities \\' single \"I Know Where Syd Barrett Lives\" [190] from their 1981 album And Don\\'t the Kids Love It is another tribute. [nb 11] In 2008, The Trash Can Sinatras released a single in tribute to the life and work of Syd Barrett called \"Oranges and Apples\", from their 2009 album In the Music . Proceeds from the single go to the Syd Barrett Trust in support of arts in mental health. Johnny Depp showed interest in a biographical film based on Barrett\\'s life. [214] Barrett is portrayed briefly in the opening scene of Tom Stoppard \\'s play Rock \\'n\\' Roll (2006), performing \"Golden Hair\". His life and music, including the disastrous Cambridge Corn Exchange concert and his later reclusive lifestyle, are a recurring motif in the work. [215] [216] Barrett died during the play\\'s run in London. In 2016, in correspondence with the 70th anniversary birthday, The Theatre of the Absurd, an Italian independent artists group, published a short movie in honour of Barrett named Eclipse , with actor-director Edgar Blake in the role of Barrett. Some footage from this movie was also shown at Syd Barrett – A Celebration during Men on the Border\\'s tribute: the show took place at the Cambridge Corn Exchange, with the participation of Barrett\\'s family and old friends. [217] For 2017 TV series Legion creator Noah Hawley named one of the characters after Barrett, whose music was an important influence on the series. [218] In The X-Files season nine episode, \" Lord of the Flies \" (2001), a powerful mutant, Dylan Lokensgard ( Hank Harris ), has several posters of Syd Barrett on his bedroom wall, and listens to \"It\\'s No Good Trying\" and \"Terrapin\" from The Madcap Laughs . [219] [220] [221] He recites the line, \"A dream in a mist of gray\", from Barrett\\'s song \"Opel\", saying of the singer, \"He was, like, this brilliant guy that no-one understood\". [222] Barrett\\'s influence on the genesis of psychedelia was considered in a chapter entitled \"Astronauts of Inner Space: Syd Barrett, Nick Drake and the Birth of Psychedelia\" in Guy Mankowski \\'s book Albion\\'s Secret History: Snapshots of England\\'s Pop Rebels and Outsiders . [223] The 2023 documentary film Have You Got It Yet? The Story of Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd features interviews with Roger Waters, Nick Mason, David Gilmour, Barrett\\'s sister Rosemary Breen, and Pink Floyd managers Peter Jenner and Andrew King. It is directed by Roddy Bogawa and Storm Thorgerson , and narrated by Jason Isaacs . [224] [225] Health Members of Barrett\\'s family denied that he was mentally ill. [9] Asked if Barrett may have had Asperger\\'s syndrome , his sister Rosemary Breen said that he and his siblings were \"all on the spectrum\". [9] [226] She also stated that, contrary to common misconception, [227] Barrett neither suffered from mental illness nor had he received treatment for it since they had resumed regular contact in the 1980s. [228] Breen said he had spent some time in a private \"home for lost souls\"—Greenwoods in Essex—but that there was no formal therapy programme there. Some years later, Barrett agreed to sessions with a psychiatrist at Fulbourn psychiatric hospital in Cambridge, but Breen said that neither medication nor therapy was considered appropriate. [228] Breen also denied Barrett was a recluse or that he was vague about his past: \"Roger may have been a bit selfish—or rather self-absorbed—but when people called him a recluse they were really only projecting their own disappointment. He knew what they wanted, but he wasn\\'t willing to give it to them.\" [229] In 1996, Wright said that Barrett\\'s mother told the members of Pink Floyd not to contact him because being reminded of the band would make him depressed for weeks. [230] In the 1960s, Barrett used psychedelic drugs, especially LSD , and there are theories he subsequently had schizophrenia . [96] [231] [232] Wright asserted that Barrett\\'s problems stemmed from a massive overdose of acid, as the change in his personality and behaviour came on suddenly. However, Waters maintains that Barrett suffered \"without a doubt\" from schizophrenia. [9] In an article published in 2006, Gilmour was quoted as saying: \"In my opinion, his nervous breakdown would have happened anyway. It was a deep-rooted thing. But I\\'ll say the psychedelic experience might well have acted as a catalyst. Still, I just don\\'t think he could deal with the vision of success and all the things that went with it.\" [233] According to Gilmour in a 1974 interview, the other members of Pink Floyd approached psychiatrist R. D. Laing with the \"Barrett problem\". After hearing a tape of a Barrett conversation, Laing declared him \"incurable\". [234] [235] In Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey , author Nicholas Schaffner interviewed people who knew Barrett before and during his Pink Floyd days, including friends Peter and Susan Wynne-Wilson, artist Duggie Fields (with whom Barrett shared a flat during the late 1960s), June Bolan, and Storm Thorgerson . Bolan became concerned when Syd \"kept his girlfriend under lock and key for three days, occasionally shoving a ration of biscuits under the door\". [236] A claim of cruelty against Barrett committed by the groupies and hangers-on who frequented his apartment during this period was described by writer and critic Jonathan Meades . \"I went [to Barrett\\'s flat] to see Harry and there was this terrible noise. It sounded like heating pipes shaking. I said, \\'What\\'s up?\\' and he sort of giggled and said, \\'That\\'s Syd having a bad trip . We put him in the linen cupboard\\'\". [237] Storm Thorgerson responded to this claim by stating \"I do not remember locking Syd up in a cupboard. It sounds to me like pure fantasy, like Jonathan Meades was on dope himself.\" [237] Other friends state that Barrett\\'s flatmates, who had also taken LSD, thought of Barrett as a genius or a deity, and were spiking his morning coffee every day without his knowledge, leaving him in a never-ending trip. He was later rescued from that flat by friends and moved elsewhere, but his erratic behaviour continued. [9] According to Thorgerson, \"On one occasion, I had to pull him [Barrett] off [his girlfriend] Lindsay because he was beating her over the head with a mandolin \". [238] On one occasion, Barrett threw a woman called Gilly across the room, because she refused to go to Gilmour\\'s house. [128] Personal life According to his sister, Rosemary, Barrett took up photography and sometimes they went to the seaside together. She also said he took a keen interest in art and horticulture and continued to devote himself to painting: Quite often he took the train on his own to London to look at the major art collections—and he loved flowers. He made regular trips to the Botanic Gardens and to the dahlias at Anglesey Abbey , near Lode . But of course, his passion was his painting. [228] [143] Barrett had relationships with various women, such as Libby Gausden; Lindsay Korner; Jenny Spires; and Pakistani-born Evelyn \"Iggy\" Rose (1947–2017) (aka \"Iggy the Eskimo\", \"Iggy the Inuit\"), who appeared on the back cover of The Madcap Laughs . [9] [239] [240] He never married or had children, [241] though he was briefly engaged to marry Gayla Pinion and planned to relocate to Oxford .

The Story of Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd (2023) See also Biography portal List of songs recorded by Syd Barrett List of songs about or referencing Syd Barrett References Informational notes ^ Barrett devised the name \"Pink Floyd\" by juxtaposing the first names of Pink Anderson and Floyd Council [40] whom he had read about in a sleeve note for a 1962 Blind Boy Fuller album: \"Curley Weaver and Fred McMullen, [...] Pink Anderson or Floyd Council—these were a few amongst the many blues singers who were to be heard in the rolling hills of the Piedmont, or meandering with the streams through the wooded valleys.\" [41] [42] ^ They recorded a cover of Slim Harpo \\'s \" I\\'m a King Bee \", and three Barrett originals: \"Double O Bo\", \"Butterfly\" and \"Lucy Leave\". [43] [44] \"Double O Bo\" and \"Lucy Leave\" survive as vinyl acetates . [44] [45] ^ While under the influence of the acid, Barrett had placed an orange, a plum and a matchbox in a corner, and then stared at this arrangement, which he claimed symbolised \"Venus and Jupiter\". [46] [47] Thorgerson later added these items to the cover of the double album combination of Barrett\\'s solo albums, Syd Barrett . [46] ^ The band were still playing R&B hits as late as early 1966, [53] [54] however, mixed in with several original songs: \"Let\\'s Roll Another One\", \"Lucy Leave\", \"Butterfly\", \"Remember Me\" and \"Walk with Me Sydney\". [53] ^ Barrett, frequently at his Earlham Street residence, played The Mothers of Invention \\'s Freak Out! , The Byrds \\' Fifth Dimension , The Fugs \\' and Love \\'s debut albums, [55] and The Beatles \\' Revolver , [56] repeatedly. All these albums were connected by their proto-psychedelic feel, which had begun to guide Barrett\\'s songs, as much as R&B had, previously. [55] \" Interstellar Overdrive \" (included into the band\\'s setlist from autumn), for example, was inspired by the riff from Love\\'s \" My Little Red Book \", the free-form section (and also, \" Pow R. Toc H. \") was inspired by Frank Zappa \\'s free-form freak-outs and The Byrds\\' \" Eight Miles High \". The Kinks\\' \" Sunny Afternoon \" was an important influence on Barrett\\'s songwriting. [55] ^ The demo recordings consist of \"I Get Stoned\" (aka \"Stoned Alone\"), \"Let\\'s Roll Another One\", \"Lucy Leave\" and a 15-minute version of \"Interstellar Overdrive\". [63] ^ The Sound Techniques session resulted in a recording of the single \" Arnold Layne \", [56] [65] and the recording of other songs: \" Matilda Mother \", \" Chapter 24 \", \"Interstellar Overdrive\" and \"Let\\'s Roll Another One\" (which was renamed to \" Candy and a Currant Bun \", at the suggestion of Waters). Referring to the choice of \"Arnold Layne\", Nick Mason said: \"We knew we wanted to be rock\\'n\\'roll stars and we wanted to make singles, so it seemed the most suitable song to condense into 3 minutes without losing too much\". [71] ^ \"Two of a Kind\" was credited to Richard Wright on the original Peel Session release, but to Barrett on later releases, including The Best of Syd Barrett: Wouldn\\'t You Miss Me? . [121] According to David Gilmour , Wright wrote the song but an increasingly confused Barrett insisted it was his own composition (and wanted to include it on The Madcap Laughs ). [122] ^ These five songs were originally released on Syd Barrett: The Peel Session . ^ These three songs, along with the five from the Top Gear performance, were released on Syd Barrett: The Radio One Sessions . ^ The Television Personalities became the subject of controversy and derision when, as they had been selected as the opening act on Gilmour\\'s About Face tour in the early 1980s, lead singer Dan Treacy decided to read aloud Barrett\\'s real home address to the audience of thousands. Gilmour removed them from the tour immediately afterwards. [213] Citations ^ a b Reed, Ryan (29 June 2013). \"How Pink Floyd Carried On With \\'A Saucerful of Secrets\\' \" . Ultimate Classic Rock .

They gained popularity performing in London’s underground music scene during the late 1960s, and under Barrett’s leadership released two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). David Gilmour joined as a fifth member in December 1967 and Barrett left the band in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health exacerbated by drug use. Waters became the band’s primary lyricist and, by the mid-1970s, their dominant songwriter, devising the concepts behind their most critically and commercially successful albums. Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd and Wright rejoined them as a session musician and later a band member. Pink Floyd reunited with Waters in 2005 for a performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006 and Wright in 2008. The final Pink Floyd studio album, The Endless River, recorded without Waters and based on material recorded in 1993–1994, was released in November 2014. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the U.K. Music Hall of Fame in 2005. By 2013, the band had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including nearly 75 million certified units in the U.S. Flip through the gallery for 10 Things You Might Not Know About Pink Floyd ! This gallery uses material from the Wikipedia article Pink Floyd , which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike License 3.0 Roger Waters met Nick Mason while they were both studying architecture at the London Polytechnic at Regent Street. They first played music together in a group named Sigma 6, which Richard Wright and Syd Barrett later joined. The band went through a number of transitory names, including the Meggadeaths before settling on the Tea Set The group first referred to themselves as the Pink Floyd Sound in late 1965. Barrett created the name on the spur of the moment when he discovered that another band, also called the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs. The name is derived from the given names of two blues musicians, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council The band’s debut album was released on August 5, 1967 and was the only one made under the leadership of Syd Barrett. Originally titled Projection, the title was taken from one of Barrett\\'s favorite books, Kenneth Grahame\\'s The Wind in the Willows. It contains a visionary encounter with the god Pan, who plays his pan pipe at dawn In early 1967, the band first noticed significant changes in Barrett\\'s behavior and the beginning of his mental breakdown. In December, the group added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member of the band. In March 1968, Pink Floyd met with their business partners to discuss the band\\'s future and Barrett agreed to leave The album was an immediate success and brought wealth to all four members. It topped the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart for one week and remained in the charts for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988. With more than 50 million copies sold, it is Pink Floyd\\'s most commercially successful album and one of the best-selling albums worldwide The concept of 1977’s Animals originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell\\'s political fable, Animal Farm. The album\\'s lyrics described different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Waters designed the final art concept, choosing an image of Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig In July 1978, Waters presented two ideas for their next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall, and the other would later become Waters\\' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former to be their next album, The Wall The album artwork for their fourteenth studio album, 1994’s The Division Bell, was designed by Storm Thorgerson and was intended to represent the absence of Barrett and Waters from the band. Thorgerson drew inspiration for the album cover from the Moai monoliths of Easter Island; two opposing faces forming an implied third face On July 2, 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd for the first time in more than 24 years at the Live 8 concert in London\\'s Hyde Park. The foursome had not performed together since a show at Earls Court in London on June 17, 1981 The band’s fifteenth and final album, The Endless River, was released November 7, 2014. It was the first studio album since the death of keyboardist and founding member Richard Wright, who appears posthumously. Described as a \"swan song\" for Wright, the album features unreleased material from the 1993-1994 Division Bell sessions Related K-SHE of the Day K-SHE of the Day K-SHE of the Day K-SHE of the Day K-SHE of the Day K-SHE of the Day Listen and Win Your Privacy Choices Cookie Preferences Privacy Statement Copyright Policy DMCA Notice EEO Annual Report FCC Applications Public File Talk of the Town Terms of Use | Advertise with Us Careers Contact Us Contest Rules Donation Request Prize Pickup | The Next Generation Of Classic Rock™ Search Need help accessing the FCC Public File due to a disability?

It is a rock opera about Pink, a jaded rock star who constructs a psychological \"wall\" of social isolation. The album was a commercial success, topping the US charts for 15 weeks and reaching number three in the UK. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it overblown and pretentious, but later received accolades as one of the greatest albums of all time. The bassist Roger Waters conceived The Wall during Pink Floyd\\'s 1977 In the Flesh tour , modelling the character of Pink after himself and Pink Floyd\\'s former member Syd Barrett . Recording spanned from December 1978 to November 1979. The producer Bob Ezrin helped to refine the album\\'s concept and bridge tensions during recording, as the band members were struggling with personal and financial issues at the time. The Wall was the last album to feature Pink Floyd as a quartet ; the keyboardist, Richard Wright , was fired by Waters during production but stayed on as a salaried musician. Three singles were issued from the album: \" Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2 \" (Pink Floyd\\'s only UK and US number-one single), \" Run Like Hell \", and \" Comfortably Numb \". From 1980 to 1981, Pink Floyd performed the full album on a tour that featured elaborate theatrical effects. In 1982, The Wall was adapted into a feature film for which Waters wrote the screenplay. The Wall is one of the best-known concept albums . [4] With over 30 million copies sold, it is the second best-selling album in the band\\'s catalogue (behind 1973\\'s The Dark Side of the Moon ), the best selling double-album of all time, [5] and one of the best-selling albums of all time overall. [6] Some of the outtakes from the recording sessions were used on the group\\'s next album, The Final Cut (1983). In 2000, it was voted number 30 in Colin Larkin \\'s All Time Top 1000 Albums . [7] In 2003, 2012, and 2020, it was included in Rolling Stone \\' s lists of the \" 500 Greatest Albums of All Time \". [8] From 2010 to 2013, Waters staged a new Wall live tour that became one of the highest-grossing tours by a solo musician . Background [ edit ] The album\\'s concept was born out of an altercation with audience members at the Montreal Olympic Stadium , pictured in 2006. In 1977, Pink Floyd played the In the Flesh tour. The bassist and singer-songwriter, Roger Waters , despised the experience, feeling the audience was not listening and that many were too far away to see the band. He said: \"It became a social event rather than a more controlled and ordinary relationship between musicians and an audience.\" [9] Some audience members set off firecrackers, leading Waters to stop playing and scold them. On 6 July 1977, the final date at the Montreal Olympic Stadium , a group of noisy and excited fans near the stage irritated Waters so much that he spat on one of them. [10] The guitarist and singer-songwriter, David Gilmour , refused to perform a final encore and sat at the soundboard, [11] leaving the band, with the backup guitarist Snowy White , to improvise a slow, sad 12-bar blues , which Waters announced to the audience as \"some music to go home to\". [12] [13] That night, Waters spoke with the producer Bob Ezrin and Ezrin\\'s psychiatrist friend about the alienation and despair he was experiencing. He articulated his desire to isolate himself by constructing a wall across the stage between the band and the audience. [14] While Gilmour and Wright were in France recording solo albums, and the drummer, Nick Mason , was busy producing Steve Hillage \\'s Green , Waters began to write material. [15] The spitting incident became the starting point for a new concept, which explored the protagonist\\'s self-imposed isolation after years of traumatic interactions with authority figures and the loss of his father as a child. [13] In July 1978, Pink Floyd reconvened at Britannia Row Studios , where Waters presented two new ideas for concept albums. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall . [16] The second was about a man\\'s dreams on one night, and dealt with marriage, sex, and the pros and cons of monogamy and family life versus promiscuity. [17] The band chose the first option; the second eventually became Waters\\'s first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984). [16] By September, Pink Floyd were having financial problems and urgently needed to produce an album to make money. [18] The financial planners Norton Warburg Group (NWG) had invested £1.3–3.3 million, up to £20.1\\xa0million in contemporary value, [19] of the group\\'s money in high-risk venture capital to reduce their tax liabilities . The strategy failed when many of the businesses NWG invested in lost money, leaving the band facing tax rates potentially as high as 83 per cent. Waters said: \"Eighty-three per cent was a lot of money in those days and we didn\\'t have it.\" [20] Pink Floyd terminated their relationship with NWG, demanding the return of uninvested funds. [21] [nb 1] Gilmour said he became closely involved in the business side of Pink Floyd afterwards: \"Ever since then, there\\'s not a penny that I haven\\'t signed for. I sign every cheque and examine everything.\" [20] To help manage the project\\'s 26 tracks, Waters decided to bring in an outside producer and collaborator, [16] feeling he needed \"a collaborator who was musically and intellectually in a similar place to where I was\". [22] They hired Ezrin at the suggestion of Waters\\'s then-wife Carolyne Christie , who had worked as Ezrin\\'s secretary. [18] Ezrin had previously worked with Alice Cooper , Lou Reed , Kiss , and Peter Gabriel . [23] From the start, Waters made it clear who was in charge, telling him: \"You can write anything you want. Just don\\'t expect any credit.\" [24] Ezrin and Gilmour reviewed Waters\\'s concept, discarding what they thought was not good enough. Waters and Ezrin worked mostly on the story, improving the concept. [25] Ezrin presented a 40-page script to the rest of the band, with positive results. He recalled: \"The next day at the studio, we had a table read, like you would with a play, but with the whole of the band, and their eyes all twinkled, because then they could see the album.\" [22] Ezrin broadened the storyline, distancing it from the autobiographical work Waters had written and basing it on a composite character named Pink. [26] The engineer Nick Griffiths later said: \"Ezrin was very good in The Wall , because he did manage to pull the whole thing together. He\\'s a very forceful guy. There was a lot of argument about how it should sound between Roger and Dave, and he bridged the gap between them.\" [27] Waters wrote most of the album, with Gilmour co-writing \" Comfortably Numb \", \" Run Like Hell \", and \" Young Lust \", [28] and Ezrin co-writing \" The Trial \". [25] Concept and storyline [ edit ] Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2 The disco beat used in \"Another Brick in the Wall Part 2\" presented a marked change from Pink Floyd\\'s previous releases. [ citation needed ] Problems playing this file? See media help . The Wall is a rock opera [29] that explores abandonment and isolation, symbolized by a wall. The songs create a storyline of events in the life of Pink, a character based on Waters and Pink Floyd\\'s former frontman Syd Barrett . [30] [31] The album includes several references to Barrett, including \" Nobody Home \", which hints at his condition during Pink Floyd\\'s abortive US tour of 1967, with lyrics such as \"wild, staring eyes\", \"the obligatory Hendrix perm\" and \"elastic bands keeping my shoes on\". \" Comfortably Numb \" was inspired by Waters \\' injection with a muscle relaxant to combat the effects of hepatitis during the In the Flesh tour in Philadelphia . [32] Plot [ edit ] The album opens with Pink, a rock star, addressing a crowd of fans at one of his concerts, to whom he is about to give an apparently unexpected performance of his life story (\" In the Flesh? \"). A flashback on his life up to that point begins, in which it is revealed that his father was killed during World War II , leaving Pink\\'s mother to raise him alone (\" The Thin Ice \"). Beginning with the death of his father, Pink starts to build a metaphorical wall around himself (\" Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1 \"). Growing older, Pink is tormented at school by tyrannical, abusive teachers (\" The Happiest Days of Our Lives \"), and memories of these traumas become metaphorical \"bricks in the wall\" (\" Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2 \"). The death of Pink\\'s father during the Battle of Anzio (pictured) forms the backdrop of the story. Now an adult, Pink remembers his domineering, overprotective mother (\" Mother \") and his upbringing during the Blitz (\" Goodbye Blue Sky \"). Pink soon marries, and after more \"bricks\" are created through more traumas, he is preparing to complete his \"wall\" (\" Empty Spaces \"). While touring in the United States, he seeks casual sex to relieve the tedium of touring, though in making a phone call home, he learns of his wife\\'s infidelity (\" Young Lust \"). He brings a groupie back to his hotel room, only to trash it in a violent fit of rage, terrifying her out of the room (\" One of My Turns \"). Depressed, Pink thinks about his wife and fantasizes about committing violence against her (\" Don\\'t Leave Me Now \"). Feeling trapped, he dismisses the impact his past has had on him while rejecting human contact and medication (\" Another Brick in the Wall, Part 3 \"). Pink\\'s wall is now finished, completely isolating himself from the outside world (\" Goodbye Cruel World \"). Immediately after the wall\\'s completion, Pink questions his decisions (\" Hey You \") and locks himself in his hotel room (\" Is There Anybody Out There? \"). Beginning to feel depressed, Pink turns to his possessions for comfort (\" Nobody Home \"), and yearns for the idea of reconnecting with his personal roots (\" Vera \"). Pink\\'s mind flashes back to World War II, with the people demanding that the soldiers return home (\" Bring the Boys Back Home \"). Returning to the present, Pink\\'s manager and roadies break into his hotel room, where they find him unresponsive. A paramedic injects him with drugs to enable him to perform at a concert later that night (\" Comfortably Numb \"). The drugs kick in, resulting in a hallucinatory on-stage performance (\" The Show Must Go On \") where he believes that he is a fascist dictator , and that his concert is a Neo-Nazi rally, at which he sets brownshirt -like men on fans that he considers unworthy (\" In the Flesh \"). He proceeds to attack minorities (\" Run Like Hell \"), culminating in him imagining holding a violence-inciting rally in suburban London (\" Waiting for the Worms \"). Pink\\'s hallucination then ceases, and he begs for everything to stop (\" Stop \"). Tormented with guilt, Pink places himself on trial before his inner judge, who orders him to \"tear down the wall\" as punishment for his actions (\" The Trial \"). This is the opening of Pink to the outside world (\" Outside the Wall \"). The album turns full circle with its closing words \"Isn\\'t this where...\", the first words of the phrase that begins the album, \"...we came in?\", with a continuation of the melody of the last song hinting at the cyclical nature of Waters\\' theme, and that the existential crisis at the heart of the album will never truly end. [33] Production [ edit ] Recording [ edit ] The Wall was recorded in several locations. In France, Super Bear Studios was used between January and July 1979, and Waters recorded his vocals at the nearby Studio Miraval . Michael Kamen supervised the orchestral arrangements at CBS Studios in New York, in September. [34] Over the next two months the band used Cherokee Studios , Producers Workshop and The Village Recorder in Los Angeles. A plan to work with the Beach Boys at the Sundance Productions studio in Los Angeles was cancelled (although Beach Boys member Bruce Johnston does sing backing vocals on \"In the Flesh?\", \"The Show Must Go On\", the side 4 version of \"In the Flesh\", and \"Waiting for the Worms\")  . [35] [36] James Guthrie , recommended by previous Floyd collaborator Alan Parsons , arrived early in the production process. [37] He replaced engineer Brian Humphries, who was emotionally drained by his five years with the band. [38] Guthrie was hired as a co-producer, but was initially unaware of Ezrin\\'s role: \"I saw myself as a hot young producer ...\\xa0When we arrived, I think we both felt we\\'d been booked to do the same job.\" [39] The early sessions at Britannia Row were emotionally charged, as Ezrin, Guthrie and Waters each had strong ideas about the direction the album would take. Relations within the band were at a low ebb, and Ezrin became an intermediary between Waters and the rest of the band. [40] As Britannia Row was initially regarded as inadequate for The Wall, the band upgraded much of its equipment, [41] and by March another set of demos was complete. However, their former relationship with NWG placed them at risk of bankruptcy, and they were advised to leave the UK by no later than 6 April 1979, for a minimum of one year. As non-residents they would pay no UK taxes during that time, and within a month all four members and their families had left. Waters moved to Switzerland, Mason to France, and Gilmour and Wright to the Greek Islands . Some equipment from Britannia Row was relocated in Super Bear Studios near Nice . [27] [42] Gilmour and Wright were both familiar with the studio and enjoyed its atmosphere, having recorded solo albums there. While Wright and Mason lived at the studio, Waters and Gilmour stayed in nearby houses. Mason later moved into Waters\\'s villa near Vence , while Ezrin stayed in Nice. [43] Ezrin\\'s poor punctuality caused problems with the tight schedule dictated by Waters. [44] Mason found Ezrin\\'s behaviour \"erratic\", but used his elaborate and unlikely excuses for his lateness as ammunition for \"tongue-in-cheek resentment\". [43] Ezrin\\'s share of the royalties was less than the rest of the band and he viewed Waters as a bully, especially when Waters mocked him by having badges made that read NOPE (No Points Ezrin), alluding to his lesser share. [44] Ezrin later said he had had marital problems and was not \"in the best shape emotionally\". [44] Waters\\' relationship with Richard Wright (pictured in 2006) collapsed during production, leading to Wright\\'s firing. More problems became apparent when Waters\\'s relationship with Wright broke down. The band were rarely in the studio together. Ezrin and Guthrie spliced Mason\\'s previously recorded drum tracks together, and Guthrie worked with Waters and Gilmour during the day, returning at night to record Wright\\'s contributions. Wright, worried about the effect that the introduction of Ezrin would have on band relationships, was keen to have a producer\\'s credit on the album. Their albums since More (1969) had credited production to \"Pink Floyd\". [45] Waters agreed to a trial period with Wright producing, after which he was to be given a producer\\'s credit, but after a few weeks he and Ezrin expressed dissatisfaction with Wright\\'s methods. A confrontation with Ezrin led to Wright working only at nights. Gilmour also expressed his annoyance, complaining that Wright\\'s lack of input was \"driving us all mad\". [46] Ezrin later reflected: \"it sometimes felt that Roger was setting him up to fail. Rick gets performance anxiety. You have to leave him alone to freeform, to create\\xa0...\" [46] Wright was troubled by a failing marriage and the onset of depression, exacerbated by his non-residency. While the other band members brought their children, Wright\\'s children were older and could not join as they were attending school; he said he missed them \"terribly\". [47] The band\\'s holidays were booked for August, after which they were to reconvene at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, but Columbia offered the band a better deal in exchange for a Christmas release of the album. Waters increased the band\\'s workload accordingly, booking time at the nearby Studio Miraval. [48] He also suggested recording in Los Angeles ten days earlier than agreed, and hiring another keyboardist to work alongside Wright, whose keyboard parts had not yet been recorded. Wright refused to cut short his family holiday in Rhodes . [49] Accounts of Wright\\'s subsequent departure from the band differ. In his autobiography, Inside Out , Mason says that Waters called the band\\'s manager, Steve O\\'Rourke , who was travelling to the US on the QE2 , and told him to have Wright out of the band by the time Waters arrived in LA to mix the album. [50] In another version recorded by a later historian of the band, Waters called O\\'Rourke and asked him to tell Wright about the new recording arrangements, to which Wright responded: \"Tell Roger to fuck off\". [51] Wright denied this, stating that the band had agreed to record only through the spring and early summer, and that he had no idea they were so far behind schedule. Mason later wrote that Waters was \"stunned and furious\", [48] and felt that Wright was not doing enough. [48] Gilmour was on holiday in Dublin when he learnt of Waters\\'s ultimatum, and tried to calm the situation. He later spoke with Wright and gave him his support, but reminded him about his minimal contributions. [52] Waters insisted that Wright leave, or he would refuse to release The Wall . Several days later, worried about their financial situation and the failing interpersonal relationships within the band, Wright quit. News of his departure was kept from the music press. [53] Although his name did not appear on some editions of the album (it does appear on the UK gatefold sleeve), [54] [55] he was employed as a session musician on the band\\'s subsequent tour. [56] By August 1979, the running order was largely complete. Wright completed his duties at Cherokee Studios aided by session musicians Peter Wood and Fred Mandel , and Jeff Porcaro played drums in Mason\\'s stead on \" Mother \". [55] Mason left the final mix to Waters, Gilmour, Ezrin and Guthrie, and travelled to New York to record his debut solo album, Nick Mason\\'s Fictitious Sports . [57] In advance of its release, technical constraints led to some changes to the running order and content of The Wall , with \"What Shall We Do Now?\" replaced by the similar but shorter \"Empty Spaces\", and \" Hey You \" being moved from the end of side three to the beginning. With the November 1979 deadline approaching, the band left the inner sleeves of the album unchanged. [58] Instrumentation [ edit ] Comfortably Numb Planet Rock listeners voted \"Comfortably Numb\"\\'s two guitar solos the greatest of all time. [59] Problems playing this file? See media help . Mason\\'s early drum sessions were performed in an open space on the top floor of Britannia Row Studios . The 16-track recordings from these sessions were mixed down and copied onto a 24-track master, as guide tracks for the rest of the band to play to. This gave the engineers greater flexibility, [nb 2] but also improved the audio quality of the mix, as the original 16-track drum recordings were synced to the 24-track master and the duplicated guide tracks removed. [60] Ezrin later related the band\\'s alarm at this method of working – they apparently viewed the erasure of material from the 24-track master as \"witchcraft\". [40] While at Super Bear studios, Waters agreed to Ezrin\\'s suggestion that several tracks, including \"Nobody Home\", \"The Trial\" and \"Comfortably Numb\", should have an orchestral accompaniment. Michael Kamen , who had previously worked with David Bowie , was booked to oversee these arrangements, which were performed by musicians from the New York Philharmonic and New York Symphony Orchestras, and a choir from the New York City Opera . [61] Their sessions were recorded at CBS Studios in New York without Pink Floyd present. Kamen eventually met the band once recording was complete. [62] I think things like \\'Comfortably Numb\\' were the last embers of mine and Roger\\'s ability to work collaboratively together. David Gilmour [63] \"Comfortably Numb\" has its origins in Gilmour\\'s debut solo album, and was the source of much argument between Waters and Gilmour. [27] Ezrin claimed that the song initially started life as \"Roger\\'s record, about Roger, for Roger\", but he thought that it needed further work. Waters changed the key of the verse and added more lyrics to the chorus, and Gilmour added extra bars for the line \"I have become comfortably numb\". Gilmour\\'s \"stripped-down and harder\" recording was not to Waters\\'s liking; Waters preferred Ezrin\\'s \"grander Technicolor, orchestral version\". Following a major argument in a North Hollywood restaurant, the two compromised; the song\\'s body included the orchestral arrangement, with Gilmour\\'s second and final guitar solo standing alone. [63] Sound design [ edit ] Ezrin and Waters oversaw the capture of the album\\'s sound effects. Waters recorded the phone call used on the original demo for \" Young Lust \", but neglected to inform its recipient, Mason, who assumed it was a prank call and angrily hung up. [64] A real telephone operator was also an unwitting participant. [65] The call references Waters\\' viewpoint of his bitter 1975 divorce from first wife Judy. [66] Waters also recorded ambient sounds along Hollywood Boulevard by hanging a microphone from a studio window. Engineer Phil Taylor recorded some of the screeching tyre noises on \"Run Like Hell\" from a studio car park, and a television set being destroyed was used on \" One of My Turns \". At Britannia Row Studios, Nick Griffiths recorded the smashing of crockery for the same song. [67] Television broadcasts were used, and one actor, recognising his voice, accepted a financial settlement from the group in lieu of legal action against them. [68] The Trial The album culminates with Pink\\'s internal trial, leading to the collapse of his \\'wall\\' Problems playing this file? See media help . The maniacal schoolmaster was voiced by Waters, and actress Trudy Young supplied the groupie \\'s voice. [67] Backing vocals were performed by a range of artists, although a planned appearance by the Beach Boys on \"The Show Must Go On\" and \"Waiting for the Worms\" was cancelled by Waters, who instead settled for Beach Boy Bruce Johnston and Beach Boys touring musician Toni Tennille . [69] Ezrin\\'s suggestion to release \" Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2 \" as a single with a disco -style beat did not initially find favour with Gilmour, although Mason and Waters were more enthusiastic. Waters opposed releasing a single, but became receptive once he listened to Ezrin and Guthrie\\'s mix. With two identical verses the song was felt to be lacking, and so a copy was sent to Griffiths in London with a request to find children to perform several versions of the lyrics. [61] Griffiths contacted Alun Renshaw, head of music at the nearby Islington Green school, who was enthusiastic, saying: \"I wanted to make music relevant to the kids – not just sitting around listening to Tchaikovsky. I thought the lyrics were great – \\'We don\\'t need no education, we don\\'t need no thought control\\xa0...\\'  I just thought it would be a wonderful experience for the kids.\" [70] Griffiths first recorded small groups of pupils and then invited more, telling them to affect a Cockney accent and shout rather than sing. He multitracked the voices, making the groups sound larger, before sending his recordings back to Los Angeles. The result delighted Waters, and the song was released as a single, becoming a Christmas number one. [71] There was some controversy when the British press reported that the children had not been paid for their efforts; they were eventually given copies of the album, and the school received a £1,000 donation (£5,000 in contemporary value [19] ). [72] Artwork and packaging [ edit ] The album\\'s cover art is one of Pink Floyd\\'s most minimal – a white brick wall and no text. Waters had a falling out with Hipgnosis designer Storm Thorgerson a few years earlier when Thorgerson had included the cover of Animals in his book The Work of Hipgnosis: \\'Walk Away René\\' . The Wall is therefore the first album cover of the band since The Piper at the Gates of Dawn not to be created by the design group. [73] Issues of the album included the lettering of the artist name and album title by cartoonist Gerald Scarfe , either as a sticker on sleeve wrapping or printed onto the cover itself, in either black or red. Scarfe, who had previously created animations for the band\\'s \"In the Flesh\" tour , also created the LP\\'s inside sleeve art and labels of both vinyl records of the album, showing the eponymous wall in various stages of construction, accompanied by characters from the story. [74] [75] The drawings were translated into dolls for The Wall Tour, as well as into Scarfe\\'s animated segments shown during the tour and the film based on the album. It is notable that the stadium drawn in the inner sleeve looks a lot like the Montreal Olympic Stadium where the album\\'s concept happens to find its origin. It seems plausible that the artist was inspired by the stadium\\'s appearance in 1977 and its inclined tower which was completed only at a third of its projected (and present) height, reminiscent of the many \"towers\" pictured in the artist\\'s stadium.

[86] Matters had not been helped when Columbia Records offered Waters smaller publishing rights on the grounds that The Wall was a double album , a position he did not accept. When one executive offered to settle the dispute with a coin toss, Waters asked why he should gamble on something he owned. He eventually prevailed. [57] The record company\\'s concerns were alleviated when \"Another Brick in the Wall Part 2\" reached number one in the UK, US, Norway, Portugal, West Germany and South Africa. [86] It was certified platinum in the UK in December 1979, and platinum in the US three months later. [87] In Germany, the album reached the one million sales mark within three months of its release. [88] In Canada, the album had sold 830,000 copies by January 1981. [89] The Wall was released in the UK and in the US on 30 November 1979. [nb 3] Coinciding with its release, Waters was interviewed by veteran DJ Tommy Vance , who played the album in its entirety on BBC Radio 1 . [73] Critical opinion of its content was mixed. [90] Reviewing for Rolling Stone in February 1980, Kurt Loder hailed it as \"a stunning synthesis of Waters\\'s by now familiar thematic obsessions\" that \"leaps to life with a relentless lyrical rage that\\'s clearly genuine and, in its painstaking particularity, ultimately horrifying.\" [91] By contrast, The Village Voice critic Robert Christgau regarded it as \"a dumb tribulations-of-a-rock-star epic\" backed by \"kitschy minimal maximalism with sound effects and speech fragments\", [92] adding in The New York Times that its worldview is \"self-indulgent\" and \"presents the self-pity of its rich, famous and decidedly post-adolescent protagonist as a species of heroism\". [93] Melody Maker declared, \"I\\'m not sure whether it\\'s brilliant or terrible, but I find it utterly compelling.\" [94] The album topped the Billboard charts for 15\\xa0weeks, [95] selling over a million copies in its first two months of sales [90] and in 1999 was certified 23× platinum. [nb 4] [96] It remains one of the best-selling albums of all time in the US, [87] [96] between 1979 and 1990 selling over 19\\xa0million copies worldwide. [97] The Wall is Pink Floyd\\'s second-best selling album after 1973\\'s The Dark Side of the Moon . Engineer James Guthrie\\'s efforts were rewarded in 1980 with a Grammy award for Best Engineered Recording (non-classical), and the album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year . [98] Rolling Stone placed it at number 87 on its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2003, [99] maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, [100] although this was updated to 129 with the list\\'s 2020 revision. [8] The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die . [101] The Wall , said Billy Corgan at his induction of the Floyd into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , was \"at my tender age of fourteen… too creepy, too intense, too nihilistic . And, of course, these are all the things that I believe in now … But at twenty-eight years old, it\\'s one of the bravest records I\\'ve ever heard. And I really can\\'t point to anything else that\\'s ever summed up everything that\\'s fucked up about life; everything that\\'s fucked up about rock. It takes on politics, hero worship, rock \\'n\\' roll, and our desires to connect with the universe, all in one fell swoop. It really, truly, is an amazing testament to how far they were willing to go to reach the outer limits of what\\'s important.\" [102] \" The Wall is stupefyingly good,\" Waters declared in 1992. \"Christ, what a brilliant idea that was. It holds together so well… And of course Dave\\'s musical influence on that was considerable. Despite what has happened between us since then, I still have great respect for him as a guitarist.\" [103] Reissues [ edit ] A 1994 digitally remastered CD version manufactured in China omits \"Young Lust\", but retains a composition credit for Waters/Gilmour in the booklet. [104] The album was reissued in three versions as part of the Why Pink Floyd...? campaign, which featured a massive restoration of the band\\'s catalogue with remastering by producer James Guthrie : in 2011, a \"Discovery\" edition, featuring the remastered version with no extras; and in 2012, both the \"Experience\" edition, which adds a bonus disc of unreleased material and other supplementary items, and the \"Immersion\" version, a seven-disc collection that also adds video materials. [105] [106] The album was reissued under the Pink Floyd Records label on 26 August 2016 along with The Division Bell . Tour [ edit ] The Wall Tour opened at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena on 7 February 1980. As the band played, a 40-foot (12\\xa0m) wall of cardboard bricks was gradually built between them and the audience. Several characters were realised as giant inflatables, including a pig, replete with a crossed hammers logo. [107] Scarfe was employed to produce a series of animations to be projected onto the wall. [107] At his London studio, he employed a team of 40\\xa0animators to create nightmarish visions of the future, including a dove of peace, a schoolmaster, and Pink\\'s mother. [108] For \"Comfortably Numb\", while Waters sang his opening verse, Gilmour waited in darkness at the top of the wall, standing on a flight case on casters, held steady by a technician, both precariously balanced atop a hydraulic platform. On cue, bright blue and white lights would suddenly illuminate him. [109] At the end of the concert, the wall collapsed, revealing the band. [110] Along with the songs on the album, the tour featured an instrumental medley, \" The Last Few Bricks \", played before \"Goodbye Cruel World\" to allow the construction crew to complete the wall. [111] During the tour, band relationships dropped to an all-time low; four Winnebagos were parked in a circle, with the doors facing away from the centre. Waters used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue, and stayed in separate hotels from the rest of the band. Wright, returning as a salaried musician, was the only member of the band to profit from the tour, which lost about £400,000. [56] Adaptations [ edit ] Waters (in spotlight), dressed in military attire, performing at The Wall\\xa0– Live in Berlin , 1990 A film adaptation, Pink Floyd – The Wall , was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in July 1982. [40] It was written by Waters and directed by Alan Parker , with Bob Geldof as Pink. It used Scarfe\\'s animation alongside actors, with little conventional dialogue. [112] A modified soundtrack was created for some of the film\\'s songs. [113] On 21 July 1990, Waters and producer Tony Hollingsworth created The Wall – Live in Berlin , staged for charity at a site once occupied by part of the Berlin Wall . [114] The concert included several artists and celebrities popular at the time, including Scorpions , Cyndi Lauper , Sinéad O\\'Connor , Joni Mitchell , Ute Lemper , Tim Curry , Van Morrison , Bryan Adams among others. The concert was broadcast on television in 52 countries, and was later released as a video and album at the end of that same year. The band omitted the song \"Outside the Wall\" and instead played \" The Tide Is Turning \", a song from Roger Waters\\' 1987 solo album Radio K.A.O.S. In 2003, the album was remastered and for the first time, the video was released on DVD. In 2000, Pink Floyd released Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980–81 , which contains portions of various live shows from the Wall Tour, but mainly the shows in the Earls Court in London. [115] In 2012, it was remastered and released on The Wall \"Immersion\" Box-Set as an extra. Beginning in 2010 [116] and with dates lasting into 2013, Waters performed the album worldwide on his tour, The Wall Live . [117] This had a much wider wall, updated higher quality projected content and leading-edge projection technology. Gilmour and Mason played at one show in London at The O2 Arena . [118] A film of the live concert, Roger Waters: The Wall , was released in 2015. [119] In 2016, Waters adapted The Wall into an opera, Another Brick in the Wall: The Opera with contemporary classical composer Julien Bilodeau. It premiered at Opéra de Montréal in March 2017, and was produced by Cincinnati Opera in July 2018. [120] It is orchestrated for a score of eight soloists, 48 chorus members, and a standard 70-piece operatic orchestra. [121] In 2018, a tribute album The Wall [Redux] was released, with individual artists covering the entire album. This included Melvins \\' version of \"In The Flesh?\", [122] Pallbearer covering \"Run Like Hell\", former Screaming Trees \\' singer Mark Lanegan covering \"Nobody Home\" and Church of the Cosmic Skull reworking \"The Trial\". [123] [124] On September 19, 2019, Channel Awesome \\'s internet series, Nostalgia Critic released a music video review of the album called Nostalgia Critic\\'s The Wall , featuring Corey Taylor and Rob Scallon . [125] The album and video received overwhelmingly poor reviews from viewers and critics.

NWG collapsed in 1981. Andrew Warburg fled to Spain, Norton Warburg Investments (a part of NWG) was renamed to Waterbrook, and many of its holdings were sold at a loss. Andrew Warburg was jailed for three years upon his return to the UK in 1987.

By Tim Ott Updated: Sep 8, 2020 Andrew Whittuck/Redferns We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. By the spring of 1967, Pink Floyd was at the forefront of the psychedelic rock movement that was pushing its way into mainstream popular culture. Fronted by lead guitarist and songwriter Syd Barrett , and including bassist Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason and organist Richard Wright, the band cracked the Top 20 in the United Kingdom with their catchy debut single, \"Arnold Layne.\" In May 1967, they made an indelible impression with the Games for May concert at London\\'s Queen Elizabeth Hall, featuring a quadraphonic sound system, dazzling light show and bubble-generating machine. As described in Crazy Diamond: Syd Barrett and the Dawn of Pink Floyd , the band was fueled by the creativity of its frontman, known for his cryptic lyrics that mixed mysticism and wordplay, and an experimental guitar style that made use of echo machines and other distortions. Sadly, the same forces that drove Barrett to artistic breakthroughs also led him down the path of self-destruction , leaving him exiled from the group shortly after they arrived on the charts and rendering him a cautionary tale as Pink Floyd became one of the biggest bands in the world. Barrett found inspiration through LSD usage Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd perform in 1966; Photo: Adam Ritchie/Redferns In 1965, as the foursome that became Pink Floyd were finding their musical footing between classes at London\\'s Regent Street Polytechnic and Camberwell College of Arts, Barrett had discovered the mind-altering effects of LSD. The turn to psychedelics had a massive impact on the group\\'s direction. Taking their cues from their frontman, Pink Floyd began doing away with the R&B covers that were being imitated by countless other bands from the era and embracing original sounds. And the highly intelligent Barrett, already known for marching to his own peculiar beat, began heavily ingesting LSD and producing song lyrics that were seemingly pulled from unknown realms of the cosmos. It was that combination of original music, stage presentation and lyrical prowess that captured the attention of record companies in the first place, but by the time Pink Floyd was being presented as the next big thing in British rock, Barrett was already losing his tenuous grasp on reality through his incessant drug use. His old friend and eventual replacement David Gilmour noticed as much when he dropped by the Chelsea Studios in May 1967 for the recording of the band\\'s second single, \"See Emily Play.\" \"Syd didn\\'t seem to recognize me and just stared back,\" Gilmour recalled in Crazy Diamond . \"I got to know that look pretty well and I\\'ll go on record as saying that was when he changed. It was a shock. He was a different person.\" The band\\'s initial success gave way to uneasiness over Barrett\\'s behavior Despite the mounting worries about their friend\\'s mental health, Pink Floyd was thriving. \"See Emily Play\" became a bigger hit than \"Arnold Layne,\" reaching No. 6 on the British charts. Furthermore, Barrett had delivered a string of brilliant songs for the group\\'s debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn . \"Chapter 24\" was inspired by I Ching , the ancient Chinese text, \"Astronomy Domine\" and \"Interstellar Overdrive\" became emblematic of the group\\'s atmospheric sound and \"Bike\" showcased its writer\\'s willingness to embrace the absurd. However, it wasn\\'t long after Piper landed in record stores in early August 1967 that Barrett\\'s deteriorating state began causing headaches for his bandmates. Later that month, it was reported that the drug-addled frontman was suffering from \"nervous exhaustion,\" forcing the group to cancel its planned appearance at the National Jazz and Blues Festival. By the time the band departed for a U.S. tour in the fall, it was clear that Barrett\\'s public presence was becoming a major problem. He stood on stage, detuning his guitar, during a gig at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, and stared catatonically at the hosts during appearances on Dick Clark\\'s American Bandstand and The Pat Boone Show . Alarmed, the band\\'s managers aborted the tour to avoid additional embarrassing incidents.

The group headed out for a U.K. tour around this time, with Barrett causing more tension by either refusing to exit the tour bus at gigs or walking off before the start of a show. Following a disastrous appearance at a Christmas concert, the band reached out to Gilmour, then fronting another struggling group called Jokers Wild. Entering 1968 with intentions of continuing as a five-piece band, Pink Floyd tried an arrangement in which Barrett would remain on board as a behind-the-scenes songwriter, before abandoning the idea of dealing with him altogether. By March 1968, Barrett was no longer with the band he co-founded and pushed to prominence. Within a few years, the remaining members of Pink Floyd were being celebrated as arena rock gods while Barrett\\'s own musical career was finished, and he spent the rest of his life away from the public eye . His presence on the group\\'s quirky early records serving as a reminder for what could have been a long and successful career for a unique, gifted artist. Even though he was no longer a member, Barrett still had an impact on Pink Floyd, and the band’s ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here , was recorded as a tribute to their co-founder.

All Rights Reserved The Tragic Real-Life Story Of Pink Floyd WEIRD HISTORY CRIME ENTERTAINMENT SCIENCE NATURE POLITICS FEATURES Entertainment Tragic Real-Life Stories The Tragic Real-Life Story Of Pink Floyd Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images By Brian Boone / Updated: Dec. 21, 2020  10:16 am EST After forming in the 1960s and releasing some albums as a joyfully and lightly psychedelic pop-rock band, Pink Floyd took a turn to the transcendent, evolving into one of the most adventurous and introspective bands of all time. The group made progressive rock palatable for the masses, who responded by keeping \\'70s masterpieces like The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here , and The Wall on the charts for years. More than 50 years after their formation, millions of teens still have a Pink Floyd phase, which involves their albums, beanbags, a basement, headphones, and probably a trip to the planetarium for a laser light show. But the band\\'s story is shrouded in both mystery and tragedy. A current of darkness and sadness runs through a lot of Pink Floyd\\'s music, which can be explained by the many awful things that have happened to its members over the years. Here, then, are the roughest events in the life of Pink Floyd. Mental illness forced Syd Barrett to retire young Koh Hasebe/shinko Music/Getty Images Syd Barrett was the original creative mind behind Pink Floyd, singing, playing guitar, and writing most of the songs on the band\\'s 1967 debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn as well as its first hit singles , \"Arnold Layne\" and \"See Emily Play.\" His life was marked by tragedy early — Barrett\\'s father died when he was just a boy, leaving his mother to raise five children on her own. Barrett poured himself into visual art and playing the classical piano, but by his teen years, he was all about rock music — and the strange new places he could take it. In 1968, the band hired singer and guitarist David Gilmour to supplement Barrett, whose onstage behavior had grown increasingly unpredictable. His mental health began to decline, thanks in part, according to Rolling Stone , to prolific use of LSD. He was out of the band by 1968, no longer able to cope with the pressures of fame and creating music while also managing a purported diagnosis of schizophrenia . How Pink Floyd wished Syd Barrett was there YouTube In June 1975, Pink Floyd was deep into the recording sessions for its ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here . It featured two centerpieces, the soaring title track and the epic nine-part suite \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\" both written, at least in part, in tribute to former band member Syd Barrett, who had left the band in the late \\'60s due to mental illness and drug issues and faded into obscurity and private life in the early \\'70s, according to Ultimate Classic Rock . One day, an interesting character showed up uninvited to a mixing session. Nobody in the band could identify this quiet, confused, heavyset guy with a shaved head and no eyebrows. Pink Floyd\\'s David Gilmour was the first to figure it out: It was Barrett, subject of the song the band was working on, and he had appeared as if by magic. Then, he slipped out without telling anyone. That would mark the last time the core five members of Pink Floyd would ever occupy the same space. However, bassist Roger Waters spotted Barrett a couple of years later. \"I bumped into him in Harrods where he used to go to buy sweets, but we didn\\'t speak,\" Waters told the Mirror . \"He sort of scuttled away.\" Syd Barrett died of cancer YouTube After leaving Pink Floyd in 1968, Syd Barrett didn\\'t disappear right away. In 1970, he released two solo albums — his only two solo albums – The Madcap Laughs and Barrett, consisting of material written during an earlier, more productive time. He played one solo show, which ended after just five songs. In 1971, Barrett told Rolling Stone , \"I\\'m disappearing, avoiding most things,\" and, \"Mostly I just waste my time.\" It was around that time that he sold off the rights to his music and retreated to the basement of his mother\\'s home in Cambridge, England, where he lived for the rest of his life. While Barrett appeared somewhat unhealthy and troubled to other members of Pink Floyd during his drop-in on a Wish You Were Here mixing session in 1975, he quietly soldiered on, privately, for more than 30 years, taking up gardening and painting, although never holding an exhibition or event. Amid reports that his health had improved in the early 2000s, Barrett passed away in Cambridge in July 2006 at the age of 60. While initial reports suggested complications from diabetes as the cause of death, the musician actually passed away from the effects of pancreatic cancer . Pink Floyd\\'s original lead singer ditched the band YouTube There\\'s just something tragic — or at least unfortunate, or regrettable — about those individuals who leave a band just before it goes on to unbelievable fame and fortune. A musician who helped form a band, or find its sound, gets left out of the glory and credit, not to mention the spoils, of making art for a living — it all seems like a cruel twist of fate. In 1963, a Royal Air Force technician working in London named Chris Dennis met Roger Waters, looking for a singer for his newly formed and as-yet unnamed band. Dennis said he was present when Syd Barrett came up with the moniker \"Pink Floyd\" and sang for the group\\'s first few official gigs, which consisted primarily of blues songs and covers. Scarcely a year after joining up, Dennis left Pink Floyd. Why? He told the Daily Mail in 2012 that he felt the band didn\\'t have a future, and he\\'d also been offered an RAF post in Bahrain. When he returned to the UK, he spotted Pink Floyd\\'s debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, in a record store. Dennis eventually got married, had some kids, and settled in Wales. \"I\\'ve no regrets. I helped start the biggest rock band in the world...\" he said. \"That\\'s enough for me.\" Okay, but ... really? Bob Klose\\'s harrowing childhood YouTube Bob Klose, also known as Rado Klose, was only briefly a member of Pink Floyd, playing guitar in a very early version of the group, and he was out by 1965. \"He was really a far better musician than any of the rest of us,\" Roger Waters said on \" Shades of Pink — The Definitive Pink Floyd Profile .\" Klose was a student at the time, and he \"had some exam problems and really felt that he had to apply himself to work, whereas the rest of us were not that conscientious.\" Klose unfortunately ditched Pink Floyd before it became successful, but he went on to enjoy a long career as a photographer. No matter which path he took to the future, though, he had to rise up from a stressful past. According to his website bio , Klose\\'s father \"was a refugee from Nazi Germany\" who had also fought in the particularly bloody Spanish Civil War . Klose was born in Cambridge and spent his first couple of years on Earth in less-than-ideal living conditions. His father had landed a job as a farm worker, and, unable to land other housing options, the family lived in a tent pitched on the property where Klose\\'s father worked. The Wall is about Roger Waters\\' mental illness and abusive childhood YouTube The Wall is among the most iconic albums in rock history. The 1979 double-LP by Pink Floyd is the sixth-best-selling album in US history, ranks among Rolling Stone\\'s top 100 records ever made, and is one of the few pieces of rock music to be adapted into a film, the trippy 1982 cult classic Pink Floyd: The Wall . That\\'s a harrowing movie about a rock star named Pink who falls into the twin voids of solitude and mental illness. Unfortunately, it\\'s partly autobiographical, thematically speaking. Pink is based on both Syd Barrett and Roger Waters, who wrote the vast majority of the album by himself. Barrett battled mental health issues, just like Pink, whose problems begin when his father dies in a war — similarly, Waters\\' dad died in World War II. Those are the first \"bricks\" in the metaphorical wall Pink builds up around himself, soon followed by various other traumas, including abusive schoolteachers, highlighted on the famous standout track \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2).\" \"The education I went through in boys\\' grammar school in the \\'50s was very controlling and demanded rebellion,\" Waters told Mojo (via SongFacts ) . \"The song is meant to be a rebellion against errant government, against people who have power over you, who are wrong.\" Richard Wright made a concept album about depression YouTube Pink Floyd is one of the few bands in which all of its core members released solo albums, either as side projects while still in the group or after leaving the fold. Keyboardist Richard Wright made three albums on his own: Wet Dream in 1978, Identity in 1984, and Broken China in 1996. The latter, like several of Pink Floyd\\'s LPs, is a concept album, with every song revolving around a common theme. Sadly, that theme is the clinical depression suffered for years by Wright\\'s wife, Millie. \"It was, of course, a very frightening and very emotional time, to witness this happening,\" the musician told the Boston Globe . Initially, he planned on an instrumental project but realized that his songs had an air of sadness to them. \"A lot of the things I write would be melancholic, and melancholic is an emotion that is certainly about sadness.\" Psychology Today called the album \"a portrait of despair and recovery\" and \"surprisingly frank\" in its depiction of Millie Wright\\'s battle, which included lots of therapy and a hospitalization. And ensuring authenticity and accuracy, Millie\\'s therapist wrote some of the lyrics on Broken China. Richard Wright died of cancer YouTube Pink Floyd would\\'ve been nothing — or at least just a standard, run-of-the-mill, guitar/bass/drums rock band — if not for Richard Wright. On every Pink Floyd album except for The Final Cut , Wright provided the soaring, haunting, spacey keyboard sounds that were the backbone of the band and which elevated the group to its status as the kings and guardians of prog rock. He also sang backup on countless Floyd tunes and occasionally penned something, notably co-writing the sweeping \"The Great Gig in Sky\" on The Dark Side of the Moon . His work in Pink Floyd ended with a whimper as well as a bang. In 1996, according to The New York Times , Wright hadn\\'t spoken with bandmate Roger Waters in 14 years, although the band did reunite (sans Syd Barrett) for a one-off performance at the Live 8 London charity concert in 2005. Just three years later, Wright died of cancer, according to his publicist. He was 65 years old. Richard Wright treated his wives poorly YouTube The love life of Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright proved as dramatic and chaotic as the man\\'s keyboard work. In 1964, he married Juliette Gale , a singer from an early incarnation of Pink Floyd. They had two children together, only for him to leave her in 1982 for the future Franka Wright, who was also married at the time. Franka told the Daily Mail that her husband frequently cheated on her with groupies and backup singers, but she couldn\\'t forgive him one final indiscretion. She surprised him on his boat in Athens one day in 1992, where Wright was accompanied by his young mistress, who was also pregnant. That was especially tough for Franka Wright, as she\\'d suffered through four unsuccessful pregnancies. \"Rick never visited me in the hospital,\" for those, she claimed. After a contentious divorce, Wright moved on to this third wife, the former Millie Hobbs. According to The Telegraph , they married in 1995 and separated in 2007, about a year before Richard Wright died from cancer. The musician left behind an estate worth about $30 million and provided for his children. What did he leave for the wives he put through so much turmoil and heartbreak? Nothing. Roger Waters broke up the band and then sued YouTube It\\'s actually quite sad when the members and chief creative forces in a band don\\'t get along. Once young people with dreams of bringing their art to the masses, they wind up bitter and old, squaring off in the press and in courtrooms, their connection ruined by the very things they set out to achieve. Pink Floyd\\'s bassist Roger Waters brought the hostility toward his bandmates for years. First, he was angry that keyboardist Richard Wright didn\\'t write enough material during the recording of The Wall, and he managed to fire the guy . Wright played on the tour in support of The Wall, as a hired backing musician. Creative tensions between Waters and David Gilmour boiled over during the recording of The Final Cut , and Waters quit the band, telling the public that Pink Floyd was summarily over without his presence. The rest of the band disagreed, and Waters sued – unsuccessfully — to prevent them from using the Pink Floyd name. The band continued to record and tour to much success into the \\'90s and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Waters didn\\'t attend. In 2013, he expressed regret for the mid-\\'80s lawsuit . \"I was wrong,\" he told the BBC . \"Of course I was. Who cares?\" David Gilmour\\'s guitars were stolen YouTube While it\\'s not as tragic as death or a devastating mental illness, a large-scale theft can be a crushing and unfortunate event to those who experience one. Pink Floyd\\'s David Gilmour is one of the world\\'s most famous, successful, and talented guitarists, so he treasures his instrument greatly. That\\'s why it was so awful when a bunch of his guitars were stolen right out from underneath him. \"I lived out in the countryside somewhere and I had a little studio room. My brother had a band; he was in there working, rehearsing with his band quite a bit, and these guitars were in that studio room,\" Gilmour said on The David Gilmour Podcast miniseries in 2019 (via Ultimate Guitar ). \"One night, it got broken into and the guitars went, and it turned out to be one of the musicians who were in my brother\\'s band at the time.\" One of those guitars wound up in a studio owned by a Gilmour associate, who recognized the instrument and returned it. \"We got most of them back,\" the guitarist said. \"A couple I never got back.\" That\\'s not even the first time Gilmour experienced grand theft music — in 1970, Pink Floyd called off its American tour after thieves absconded with the group\\'s equipment.

Pink Floyd ‘s eternally popular song cycle has sold more than 15 million copies in the U.S. since its release on March 1st, 1973, and more than 45 million units worldwide. A true colossus of classic rock, the album made its creators — bassist/vocalist Roger Waters , guitarist/vocalist David Gilmour , keyboardist/vocalist Rick Wright, and drummer Nick Mason — incredibly wealthy, and ultimately spent a mind-boggling 937 weeks on the Billboard 200. In addition to its massive commercial success, Dark Side of the Moon was also a career-defining artistic achievement for the British quartet, one which marked Pink Floyd ‘s transition from an experimental, jam-oriented progressive outfit primarily beloved by college students and assorted “heads,” to a top-echelon rock act characterized by its rich songwriting – as well as by Waters’ mordant worldview. Recorded at London’s Abbey Road Studios in various sessions from May 1972 through January 1973, the album’s cerebral soundscapes (exquisitely captured on tape by Abbey Road engineer Alan Parsons, and mixed with the help of veteran producer Chris Thomas) and heavy lyrical musings on the human condition inspired countless bong-fueled headphone listening sessions in darkened bedrooms, but its songs also sounded great on FM (and even AM) radio. And, perhaps most crucially, the record had genuine meaning. Originally conceived by the band as a cohesive collection of songs about the pressures of life as a musician, Dark Side of the Moon eventually expanded to include songs about broader topics such as wealth (“Money”), armed conflict (“Us and Them”), madness (“Brain Damage”), squandered existences (“Time”) and death (“The Great Gig in the Sky”). As Waters told Rolling Stone in 2011 , “ Dark Side was the first [Pink Floyd album] that was genuinely thematic and genuinely about something.” And as artists like Radiohead and Flaming Lips (both of whom have been profoundly influenced by Dark Side ) can attest, the album’s music and lyrics still hold up beautifully today. Editor’s picks The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 50 Worst Decisions in Movie History Every Awful Thing Trump Has Promised to Do in a Second Term Here are 10 things you might not know about Dark Side of the Moon . 1. Dark Side of the Moon was the first Pink Floyd album to feature Roger Waters as its sole lyricist. Roger Waters had been contributing lyrics to Pink Floyd albums since 1968’s A Saucerful of Secrets (he also received co-writing credit on the instrumentals “Pow R. Toc H.” and “Interstellar Overdrive” from The Piper at the Gates of Dawn , the band’s 1967 debut), but Dark Side marked the first — though definitely not the last — time that the bassist took the lyrical reins for an entire Floyd LP. Along with adhering to a cohesive concept, Waters wanted Dark Side to feature lyrics that were more lucid and direct than anything the band had written before. “That was always my big fight in Pink Floyd,” Waters is quoted as saying in Mark Blake’s Comfortably Numb – The Inside Story of Pink Floyd . “To try and drag it kicking and screaming back from the borders of space, from the whimsy that Syd [Barrett, the band’s original leader, who had written the bulk of the material on Piper ] was into, to my concerns, which were much more political and philosophical.” Though Waters’ lyrical dominance on Dark Side essentially planted the seeds for the massive rift that would eventually occur between him and the rest of the band, it was actually welcomed at the time. “I never rated myself terribly highly in the lyrics department, and Roger wanted to do it,” Gilmour admitted to Rolling Stone in 2011. “I think it was a sense of relief that he was willing to do that. At the same time, him being the lyricist and more of the driving force didn’t ever mean that he ought to be in full charge of the direction on the musical side of things. So we’ve always had a little bit of tension in those areas.” 2. The album was very nearly called Eclipse . From the beginning, the band had intended to call their new album Dark Side of the Moon — a reference to lunacy, as opposed to outer space — but when British heavy blues rockers Medicine Head released an album of the same name in 1972, it caused the Floyd to rechristen their project as Eclipse . “We weren’t annoyed at Medicine Head,” Gilmour told Sounds magazine. “We were annoyed because we had already thought of the title before the Medicine Head album came out.” But when the Medicine Head album stiffed and quickly sank into obscurity, Pink Floyd felt free to revert back to their album’s original title.

Floyd fans were first treated to Dark Side of the Moon in concert more than a year before the album was actually released. Though the lush textures and spacious arrangements of Dark Side of the Moon make it sound like a purely “studio” project, the band actually aired out all of the songs in concert — in the exact same sequence that they would appear on the album — more than a year before the album’s official release. The band premiered Dark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics (as it was provisionally known at the time) at the Brighton Dome on January 20th, 1972; and though it was inadvertently cut short that night by what Waters called “severe mechanical and electric horror,” the band went on to perform the song cycle in its entirety in during the rest of their 1972 live dates, further refining the songs (and the transitions between them) as they went. The band would eventually record all 10 of the album’s songs onto the same reel of 16-track master tape at Abbey Road, an unusual approach that nonetheless paid considerable artistic dividends. “The way one track flowed into another was an extremely important part of the overall feel,” Alan Parsons told Rolling Stone in 2011. “So we could work on the transitions as part of the recording process rather than just part of the mixing process.” 4. The original live arrangement of “On the Run” bore little resemblance to the electronic freakout on the record. Of all the Dark Side songs played live by the band in 1972, “On the Run” was the one that was most radically transformed in the studio. Originally known as “The Travel Sequence,” the instrumental was originally a guitar-driven jam — but it received a massive electronic makeover in the studio, thanks to a portable modular analog synthesizer known as the EMS Synthi AKS. The synth, which featured a built-in keyboard and sequencer contained in a suitcase (appropriately ironic, since the piece was originally inspired by Wright’s fear of flying), was also used on the album’s “Any Colour You Like.” “There were endless, interesting possibilities for that little device,” Gilmour told Rolling Stone . “We’d always considered ourselves as being a bit electronic. I always had an obsession with finding sounds that would turn something into 3D.” 5. “Money” was influenced by Booker T and the MGs. Pink Floyd’s first Top 20 hit in the U.S. (it reached Number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July 1973), “Money” is Dark Side ‘s most aggressively rocking track. With its tricky 7/4 time signature (except for during the guitar-solo segment, when the song switches to 4/4), Waters’ indelible bass riff, Gilmour’s wailing guitar lead, a squalling solo from saxophonist Dick Parry, and a distinctive sound collage loop made up of ringing cash registers and rattling coins, the recording all but obscures its roots in the Memphis R&B of Booker T and the MGs — but they’re definitely in there, according to Gilmour. “Getting specific about how and what influenced what is always difficult,” he told Rolling Stone in 2003 , “but I was a big Booker T fan. I had the Green Onions album when I was a teenager. And in my previous band, we were going for two or three years, and we went through Beatles and Beach Boys, on to all the Stax and soul stuff. We played ‘Green Onions’ onstage. I’d done a fair bit of that stuff; it was something I thought we could incorporate into our sound without anyone spotting where the influence had come from. And to me, it worked. Nice white English architecture students getting funky is a bit of an odd thought … and isn’t as funky as all that [ laughs ]. 6. Paul McCartney’s contributions to the album were deleted – but the Beatles made a surprise appearance on the record. In an attempt to further tie Dark Side ‘s songs together, Roger Waters came up with the idea of recording interviews with Abbey Road staffers, road crew members, and anyone else working at the studio — asking them a series of questions about subjects ranging from the banal (favorite colors and foods) to the deeply serious (madness and death) — and then threading some of the interview snippets into the final mix. Paul McCartney, who was finishing Wings’ Red Rose Speedway album at Abbey Road, was actually among the interviewees, but Waters deemed his answers unusable. “He was the only person who found it necessary to perform , which was useless, of course,” Waters told Pink Floyd biographer John Harris. “I thought it was really interesting that he would do that. He was trying to be funny , which wasn’t what we wanted at all.” Even so, McCartney — or at least his music — still managed to make a brief appearance on the album. If you listen close to the end of “Eclipse,” the album’s closing track, a passage from an orchestral version of the Beatles’ “Ticket to Ride” can be heard; the song was apparently playing in the background at the studio while Abbey Road doorman Gerry O’Driscoll (who delivered the immortal lines, “There is no dark side of the moon, really. Matter of fact, it’s all dark. The only thing that makes it look light is the sun.”) was being recorded. 7. “Us and Them” was a reject from the Zabriskie Point soundtrack. The second of two singles released from Dark Side (“Money” was the first) and a minor hit in the U.S. and Canada, “Us and Them” began life in 1969 as a lovely piano-and-bass instrumental called “The Violent Sequence,” which as written by Wright and Waters and submitted for inclusion in the soundtrack of Michelangelo Antonioni’s counterculture drama Zabriskie Point . While the Italian director would eventually include three Pink Floyd recordings — “Heart Beat, Pig Meat,” “Crumbling Land” and “Come in Number 51, Your Time Is Up” — on the soundtrack, he didn’t feel that “The Violent Sequence” was appropriate for the film. In an interview for Classic Albums: The Making of Dark Side of the Moon , Waters recalled Antonioni saying, “It’s beautiful, but too sad. It makes me think of church!” More than two years after it was initially rejected by Antonioni, the band revisited the demo and recast it as a moving meditation on war and poverty. 8. An image of the Silver Surfer was originally considered for the album’s cover. With its evocative, eye-catching graphic of a prism turning light into color, Dark Side of the Moon ‘s album cover — created by English graphic designer George Hardie with input from Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis – is one of the most iconic designs to ever grace an LP. “When Storm showed us all the ideas, with that one, there was no doubt,” Gilmour recalled to Rolling Stone in 2003. “It was, ‘That is it .’ It’s a brilliant cover. One can look at it after that first moment of brilliance and think, ‘Well, it’s a very commercial idea: It’s very stark and simple; it’ll look good great in shop windows.’ It wasn’t a vague picture of four lads bouncing in the countryside. That fact wasn’t lost on us.” So it’s interesting to imagine the album with an entirely different cover — specifically, the one suggested by Hipgnosis that would have featured an image based on the comic book character the Silver Surfer. “We were all into Marvel Comics, and the Silver Surfer seemed to be another fantastic singular image,” Powell recalled in an interview with John Harris. “We never would have got permission to use it. But we liked the image of a silver man, on a silver surfboard, scooting across the universe. It had mystical, mythical properties. Very cosmic , man!” 9. Dark Side of the Moon was the first Pink Floyd album to break into the US Top 40. Given Dark Side ‘s multi-platinum sales figures, and the impressive Stateside success of Pink Floyd’s subsequent studio albums, it’s easy to forget that the band’s first seven LPs all fared pretty poorly in the United States; before Dark Side , the band’s biggest U.S. hit had been Obscured by Clouds , their soundtrack for the French film La Vallée , which peaked at Number 46 on the Billboard 200 in the summer of 1972. But thanks to a massive promotional push by Capitol Records, and regular spins of “Money” by American radio DJs, Dark Side of the Moon rose all the way to the top of the Billboard 200 within two months of its release. “It went up the American charts quite quickly,” Waters recalled to Rolling Stone in 2003. “We were on tour in the States while that was happening. It was obviously going to be a big record — particularly after AM as well as FM radio embraced ‘Money.\\'” 10. Proceeds from the album helped fund Monty Python and the Holy Grail . As if Dark Side of the Moon wasn’t enough of a pop cultural landmark in itself, the album’s success was also partly responsible for the existence of the brilliantly absurd 1975 film comedy Monty Python and the Holy Grail . The members of Pink Floyd often spent their downtime during the Dark Side sessions watching Monty Python’s Flying Circus on BBC2, so when the British comedy troupe ran into difficulty raising money for their first full-length feature film, the Floyd — now flush with cash from the sales of Dark Side — were more than happy to pony up 10 percent of the film’s initial £200,000 budget. “There was no studio interference because there was no studio; none of them would give us any money,” Holy Grail director Terry Gilliam recalled in a 2002 interview with The Guardian . “This was at the time [British] income tax was running as high as 90 percent, so we turned to rock stars for finance. Elton John, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, they all had money, they knew our work and we seemed a good tax write-off. Except, of course, we weren’t.

The band’s net worths, ranked: from Roger Waters’ US$16 million Bahamian investment with Shakira, to rival David Gilmour’s solo success | South China Morning Post Style Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Celebrities Who’s the richest Pink Floyd member? The band’s net worths, ranked: from Roger Waters’ US$16 million Bahamian investment with Shakira, to rival David Gilmour’s solo success STORY Diem Nguyen Le Apr 16 , 2022 Past and present members of Pink Floyd have a combined net worth of nearly US$800 million, but who’s the richest of them all? Photo: Handout Dadrockers of the world, rejoice – the legendary Pink Floyd have returned for the first time after nearly three decades away. The rousing anti-war plea Hey Hey, Rise Up! marks the British band’s first new music since 1994’s “The Division Bell” , and while it’s been touted as an unprecedented one-off in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it’s still sent music fans scurrying down the white rabbit hole of the band’s 55-year history. The comeback was notably recorded by guitarist David Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason, with guests appearances from eclectic British musician/producer Nitin Sawhney and Ukrainian vocalist Andriy Khlyvnyuk. Founding member Roger Waters – who left the fold acrimoniously in 1985 – was notably absent, with long-standing session stand-in Guy Pratt on bass duties. Khlyvnyuk left his band Boombox’s American tour to join the army and fight for his country, before being injured. Gilmour, who has a Ukrainian daughter-in-law and grandchildren, felt moved by Khlyvnyuk’s story and picked up his guitar once again with his band. Pink Floyd has a history of recording epic anti-war music on albums “The Wall” and “The Final Cut” (both primarily penned by Waters), and songs Us And Them and The Dogs Of War . Who’s the richest Rolling Stones member? The band’s net worths, ranked Founded in London in 1965, the band has sold some 250 million albums worldwide. Among them, “Dark Side Of The Moon” and “The Wall” were listed first and eighth in the top 10 best selling albums of the 1970s, with 50 million and 33 million copies, respectively, according to BestSellingAlbums. The band’s collective net worth is nearly US$800 million, and while many classic rock groups at this point in their careers have a chequered list of former members, Pink Floyd have only ever had five official members: the original guitarist Syd Barrett and late keyboardist Richard Wright, Mason, plus arch enemies Gilmour and Waters. So, according to the number crunches at Celebrity Net Worth, who came out on top when it came to cash flow? 5. Syd Barrett – US$5 million Despite his short spell with Pink Floyd from 1965 to 1968, Syd Barrett has never been forgotten as the band’s co-founder, frontman and principal songwriter in their early years. He appeared on four seminal singles and the group’s first two first studio albums, with his approach defining breakout debut Piper at the Gates of Dawn ’s psychedelic style. After leaving the band, he was replaced by Gilmour, and released two solo albums before retiring from music in 1972. Suffering from well-known personal problems, he then dedicated his time to what he learned at Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology – painting, as well as gardening. Any wealth he accrued in his lifetime is unlikely to include the value of his artworks, as he destroyed most of them, per Rare . Several of the remaining paintings were sold after his death in 2006, fetching US$158,000 to fund an art training programme in his hometown of Cambridge, according to The Independent, and his contributing to his estate’s estimated value of US$5 million. 5 times Will Smith lost his cool and got in trouble 4. Richard Wright – US$70 million The co-founder brought a distinctive sound to the band with his richly textured keyboard performances. Richard Wright occasionally provided lead vocals and penned significant parts of classic albums like “Dark Side Of The Moon”, “Wish You Were Here” and “The Division Bell”. Outside Pink Floyd, he recorded two solo studio albums and worked with Barrett on his final studio album, and with Gilmour on some of his solo records and live albums. Profits from these and royalty streams with the band over the decades brought him in a net worth of US$70 million . After Wright passed away due to cancer in 2008, he left everything to his three children but nothing to his three former wives, according to Rock Celebrities. 3. Nick Mason – US$180 million If that figure seems high, know that drummer Nick Mason is the only member to appear on every Pink Floyd album, and he also contributed to writing some of their most popular songs Echoes and Time . In 1981, he released a single solo album, “Fictitious Sports”. The 78-year-old has continued to join both Waters and Gilmour on stage on occasions. In 2018, he formed a new band, Nick Mason’s Saucerful of Secrets alongside Pratt – named after the band’s second album – to perform Pink Floyd’s early psychedelic music. He also has his own label, Nick Mason Music, and holds stakes in several other businesses, like music licensing marketplace Lickd and Football Ventures. With an estimated wealth of US$180 million, Mason easily pampers his passion for motorsports, and even participates in some races. In fact, looking at his collection might leave you “comfortably numb”, with some 40 motors from brands like Ferrari, Bugatti, Aston Martin, Porsche, Bentley and Jaguar, per Hot Cars . One of his most-prized cars is the iconic 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO, one of the world’s most expensive cars. He reportedly turned down a US$30 million offer for it! Because that’s the kind of rock star he is. Who were the best and worst dressed stars of the Oscars 2022? 2. David Gilmour – US$180 million The only non-founding member, David Gilmour joined Pink Floyd back in 1967 as the lead guitarist, taking over lead vocal duties after Barrett left, and assuming the role as de facto leader after Waters’ departure. The 76-year-old built a career with Pink Floyd as well as a successful solo one, with all four solo studio albums charting well, all helping him amass the same fortune as Mason’s. But Gilmour doesn’t keep it all for himself. Over the years, he has took part in many charities addressing climate change, homelessness, human rights and other good causes. In 2019, he auctioned 126 of his guitars for US$21 million at a charity auction in New York to fight against climate change. His “Black Strat”, a 1969 Fender Stratocaster which he used to record “Dark Side Of The Moon”, “Wish You Were Here” and “The Wall”, sold for nearly US$4 million, a new world record for a guitar at an auction. Not just Jada Pinkett Smith – 10 celebrities who suffer from alopecia 1. Roger Waters – US$310 million The band’s co-founder and bassist, Roger Waters switched up to become the main lyricist and co-lead singer after Barrett’s departure, growing into the visionary songwriter behind their proggier moments such at “The Wall” and writing the follow-up “The Final Cut” in its entirety. Since leaving the band in 1985, he has released four solo albums, solidifying his own niche as a music icon. Moreover, the 78-year-old has almost doubled his wealth to US$310 million, compared to other Floyds, due to his mammoth touring schedule dining out on former glory. Among them, his The Wall Live Tour 2010-2013 grossed US$460 million across 220 performances, with 4.1 million tickets sold, becoming one of the top 10 grossing concert tours of all time. Additionally, Waters also made bank from a smart collaboration with pop star Shakira, although it isn’t for a music joint. They invested US$16 million to buy a 700-acre Bahamian island with five beaches and three bays, to offer a retreat for artists, per Cheat Sheet. Want more stories like this?

Here’s why \"Hey Hey Rise Up\" is the band\\'s first newly conceived single since 1994\\'s \"The Division Bell.\" April 8, 2022, 12:01 PM UTC By Variety Pink Floyd has announced that a newly recorded single under the band banner, “Hey Hey Rise Up,” is out as of Friday, with lead vocals not by David Gilmour but rather a Ukrainian singer, whose a cappella vocals from an Instagram post shot in Kyiv’s Sofiyskaya Square have been set to music by the veteran band. The music for the new song was recorded March 30 by longtime members Gilmour and Nick Mason , along with longtime bass player Guy Pratt and keyboardist Nitin Sawhney. Roger Waters, who split from the group in the mid-1980s, did not participate. The vocalist grafted into the new Pink Floyd track is Andriy Khlyvnyuk of the Ukrainian band Boombox. The vocal is taken from an Instagram video he posted five weeks ago in which he sings a World War I-era Ukrainian protest song, “The Red Viburnum in the Meadow,” which has seen a revival as a cry against the Russian war upon Ukraine. The final line of the song translates as “Hey hey, rise up and rejoice.” Khlyvnyuk is now in a hospital in Kyiv with a mortar shrapnel wound. “I played him a little bit of the song down the phone line and he gave me his blessing,” Gilmour said in a statement. “We both hope to do something together in person in the future.” An announcement declared that “Hey Hey Rise Up” is “the first new original music that they have recorded together as a band since 1994’s ‘The Division Bell.’” The group is understood to have been basically retired as a going unit since the late ’90s, although a mostly instrumental album of adapted leftovers, “The Endless River,” came out in 2014 and was declared to be their official swan song. Pink Floyd (L-R Nick Mason, Rick Wright, Roger Waters and Syd Barrett) pose for a portrait in 1967 in London, England Michael Ochs Archives / Getty Images Gilmour’s interest in bringing the band out of effective retirement for this is personal: he has a Ukrainian daughter-in-law and grandchildren. “We, like so many, have been feeling the fury and the frustration of this vile act of an independent, peaceful democratic country being invaded and having its people murdered by one of the world’s major powers,” the singer-guitarist said in a statement. The music video, directed by Mat Whitecross, has also been released, which was shot while the players were still assembled for the recording session on March 30. “We recorded the track and video in our barn where we did all our Von Trapped Family live streams during lockdown,” Gilmour said. “It’s the same room that we did the ‘Barn Jams’ with Rick Wright [Pink Floyd’s now-deceased keyboard player] back in 2007. Janina Pedan made the set in a day and we had Andriy singing on the screen while we played, so the four of us had a vocalist, albeit not one who was physically present with us.” Gilmour has known the band Boombox since 2015, when he did a benefit show at Koko in London for imprisoned members of a Belarus theater troupe along with Pussy Riot. While Boombox was supposed to do its own set that night, Khlyvnyuk was unable to attend due to a visa problem, and the other members ended up backing Gilmour on his own set, and they dedicated “Wish You Were Here” to the absent singer. “Recently I read that Andriy had left his American tour with Boombox, had gone back to Ukraine, and joined up with the Territorial Defense,” Gilmour said. “Then I saw this incredible video on Instagram, where he stands in a square in Kyiv with this beautiful gold-domed church and sings in the silence of a city with no traffic or background noise because of the war. It was a powerful moment that made me want to put it to music.” Gilmour said the purpose of the new Floyd single is to “raise funds for humanitarian charities, and raise morale.\" \"We want express our support for Ukraine and in that way, show that most of the world thinks that it is totally wrong for a superpower to invade the independent democratic country that Ukraine has become.” Pink Floyd has not toured since the ’90s, and it\\'s been several years since Gilmour has been on the road as a solo artist, but Mason is about to hit the road again with his group, Nick Mason’s Saucerful of Secrets, that revives the late ’60s and early ’70s Floyd catalog.

These core members contributed greatly to shaping the sound and identity of the band. Syd Barrett (born 1946, passed away in 2006) was the band’s original lead singer, guitarist, and primary songwriter in the early years. He was pivotal in setting the psychedelic tone that Pink Floyd initially became known for. Nick Mason , born on January 27, 1944, is the only member to have been consistently part of the band since its formation. As of 2023, he is 79 years old. He is primarily the drummer and occasional composer for the band. Roger Waters (born September 6, 1943) was the bassist and, after Barrett’s departure, the band’s primary lyricist and one of its lead vocalists. Waters has been a significant creative force behind many of Pink Floyd’s most famous works. As of 2023, he is 80 years old. Richard Wright (born July 28, 1943, passed away on September 15, 2008) was the band’s keyboardist. His atmospheric style of play added depth and texture to the band’s sound. David Gilmour , born on March 6, 1946, joined Pink Floyd in 1968 as a guitarist and co-lead vocalist. Over time, he became one of the primary musical forces in the band, especially after Barrett’s departure and Wright’s decreasing role. As of 2023, he is 77 years old. Additional and Touring Members Pink Floyd’s legendary sound is not only the product of their core members. Their lineup has often benefited from the inclusion of additional and touring musicians who made significant contributions to specific albums and performances. Rado ‘Bob’ Klose was an early contributing member who played guitar with the band before their transformation into Pink Floyd. Keyboardist Jon Carin and Guy Pratt on bass were crucial touring members during the band’s later years. Clare Torry’s unforgettable vocals in ‘The Great Gig in the Sky’ helped shape\\xa0the band’s iconic sound. Dick Parr y contributed his saxophone skills on albums like ‘The Dark Side of the Moon’ and ‘Wish You Were Here’. Sam Brown and Durga McBroom provided backup vocals during live performances, giving depth to the band’s on-stage presence. Achievements, Contributions, and Milestones PINK FLOYD EVOLUTION 1964-2020 | Songs, Albums, Members, The Wall Pink Floyd’s journey features a series of interesting facts, achievements, and contributions marking their influence on the music world. Recognition in Music Halls of Fame Pink Floyd’s monumental contributions to the world of rock music have been recognized with inductions into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Being in both Halls of Fame is a rarity in the music industry and places Pink Floyd among the all-time greats. ‘Dark Side of the Moon’ Shattered Billboard Records The 1973 album “Dark Side of the Moon” remains a high point in Pink Floyd’s discography for multiple reasons. Beyond its groundbreaking musical innovation, the album earned a spot on the Billboard charts for an astounding 741 weeks. This album has been praised for its thematic unity, sonic experimentation, and commercial longevity, and it remains one of the best-selling albums globally. Audio-Visual Innovation in Rock Concerts Pink Floyd – “Another Brick in The Wall  ” PULSE Remastered 2019 Pink Floyd redefined the concept of a rock concert by incorporating visual and auditory elements that were groundbreaking at the time. From elaborate lighting to unique stage designs, the band set a new standard for what audiences could expect. This innovation is captured in live albums such as “Pulse,” demonstrating Pink Floyd’s commitment to creating unforgettable live music experiences. Success of the Single “Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2” While Pink Floyd was traditionally more album-focused, their 1979 single “Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2” managed to reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. This achievement was noteworthy because it signaled the band’s versatility and ability to create songs that could stand alone while also fitting into a broader album narrative. The Album and Film Adaptation of ‘The Wall’ The 1979 album ‘The Wall’ stands as a unique endeavor in Pink Floyd’s history. Besides its musical achievements, it spawned a feature film adaptation in 1982. The album and the film work together to create a multi-layered narrative experience, contributing to the band’s reputation as pioneers in merging different forms of art. The Bonds and Controversies within Pink Floyd While Pink Floyd’s music firmly established them as rock legends, the relationships and tensions within the band were equally notable. Their history is peppered with controversies, legal battles, and personal disputes. The Waters-Gilmour Feud and Its Impact on the Band’s Name What happened between Roger Waters and David Gilmour? One of the most publicized disputes in Pink Floyd’s history was the intense feud between Roger Waters and David Gilmour. This feud came to a head in 1985 when Waters left the band and initiated a legal battle over the rights to the band’s name. Waters lost the battle, and the remaining members continued under the Pink Floyd moniker. The fallout from this dispute significantly affected the band’s dynamic and led to years of animosity between Waters and Gilmour, even affecting the content and tone of subsequent solo projects. Syd Barrett’s Departure and Its Emotional Toll Syd Barrett was the founding member and the initial creative force behind Pink Floyd. However, his struggles with mental health and substance abuse increasingly interfered with his ability to participate in the band. Eventually, these issues led to his departure and he was replaced by David Gilmour. Barrett’s exit was not just a change in lineup but a deeply emotional event for the band, influencing several songs that focused on themes of loss and disconnection. The Brief Reunion at Live 8 in 2005 In spite of their longstanding differences and disputes, the core members of Pink Floyd—Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright—reunited for a brief but monumental performance at the Live 8 charity concert in 2005. This event was significant not just for fans who had long hoped for a reunion, but also as a testament to the enduring but complex relationships between the members. Richard Wright’s Firing and Rehiring Roger Waters’ assertive control over the band in the late 1970s and early 1980s led to several tensions within the group, most notably with keyboardist Richard Wright. Wright was fired during the “The Wall” sessions but was later rehired as a session musician for the tour. His firing and rehiring underscored the internal power dynamics and creative disagreements that were a recurring theme in the band’s history. Conclusion Pink Floyd’s members have created a legendary musical tapestry that has influenced multiple generations. Their individual and collective achievements stand as towering milestones in the world of rock music. The intricate interplay of personal and professional relationships within the band adds another layer of depth to their story, reminding us that even amidst discord, creativity can flourish.

Who was the only member of the band to make money on \\'The Wall\\' tour? What famous rocker\\'s dog was featured on a Pink Floyd album? Did Roger Waters really buy a guitar to punish his mom? Find out the answers to these and other lesser-known things in our list of 20 Facts You Probably Didn\\'t Know About Pink Floyd. 1 Pink Floyd concerts were always a multimedia event. As early as 1966, the group\\'s live performances incorporated film, projected onto a backdrop and onto the band. 2 Before David Gilmour joined Pink Floyd as their guitarist, Syd Barrett held that position. But there was another guitar player too: Bob Klose played on the group\\'s first demos, before departing for a career in photography. He later worked with Gilmour on his 2006 solo album \\'On an Island.\\' loading... 3 While their music has long been associated with mind-expanding drug use, besides Syd Barrett, the members of Pink Floyd only casually experimented with acid. In fact, they hadn\\'t even tried whiskey until Janis Joplin passed them some during a tour in 1967. loading... 4 Roger Waters came into the band as a guitarist too. But with Syd Barrett and then Bob Klose on board, Waters moved from lead to rhythm guitar and then to bass. \"There was always this frightful fear that I could land up as the drummer,\" he once said. loading... 5 Nick Mason, who rarely received a songwriting credit despite appearing on every Pink Floyd recording, is the group\\'s only published author. He\\'s released a book on classic cars (1998\\'s \\'Into the Red\\') and a personal history of Floyd (2004\\'s \\'Inside Out\\'). loading... 6 Everyone thinks problems between Roger Waters and David Gilmour surfaced around \\'The Wall.\\' In truth, friction already existed during the run-up to 1969\\'s \\'Ummagumma.\\' Each member had been tasked with constructing a solo contribution. When Gilmour asked Waters for some lyrical help, his response was a simple \"no.\" 7 One of the band\\'s roadies, Alan Stiles, provided the audio for \\'Alan\\'s Psychedelic Breakfast\\' on 1970\\'s \\'Atom Heart Mother.\\' Pink Floyd used actual recordings of Stiles preparing a meal in Nick Mason\\'s kitchen. 8 The dog on 1971\\'s \\'Seamus\\' belonged to Steve Marriott. David Gilmour, who was watching the Irish wolfhound while Humble Pie were on tour in the U.S., discovered it would howl when someone played a harmonica. 9 Stanley Kubrick asked to license the title track from \\'Atom Heart Mother\\' for the soundtrack to \\'A Clockwork Orange,\\' but Pink Floyd declined when the director indicated that he wanted to dismantle the song for use throughout the film. 10 Many consider 1971\\'s \\'Echoes\\' to be the group\\'s ultimate stereophonic experiment. For Pink Floyd, however, there was nothing to it: The track\\'s original name was \\'Nothing, Parts 1-24.\\' After later edits, the song was called \\'Return of the Son of Nothing\\' before it received its final title. 11 Alan Parsons was given a Grammy for his engineering efforts on 1973\\'s \\'The Dark Side of the Moon,\\' but almost nothing else. \"I earned little or no money from the album,\" he has said. \"But that\\'s offset by the fact that it did wonders for my career.\" 12 Adrian Maben, who directed Pink Floyd\\'s concert film \\'Live at Pompeii,\\' said Pink Floyd hired a person specifically to say no over and over again to interview requests during their \\'Dark Side\\'-era tours. The idea was to \"remain unseen, enigmatic,\" he said. 13 Clare Torry\\'s vocal on \\'The Great Gig in the Sky\\' was completely improvised. \\'We told her ... think about death, think about horror, which she did,\" co-writer Richard Wright once said. \"And out came this wonderful vocal.\" 14 On the 1975 song \\'Welcome to the Machine,\\' Roger Waters sings, \"You bought a guitar to punish your ma.\" In reality, Waters\\' mother bought his first guitar, giving it to him back in 1957. loading... 15 Roger Waters fired Richard Wright during the sessions for 1979\\'s \\'The Wall,\\' but then brought him back as a contract-labor sideman for the subsequent, money-losing tour. That made Wright the only member of Pink Floyd not to lose money on the tour. He wouldn\\'t become a full-time member of the group again until 1994\\'s \\'The Division Bell.\\' 16 That bit of gibberish just before the lyrics begin on \\'The Wall\\'\\'s \\'Empty Spaces\\' is backward-masked dialogue that states, \"Congratulations. You have just discovered the secret message.\" 17 David Gilmour\\'s absence from a series of writing sessions with Anthony Moore sparked Pink Floyd\\'s 1987, post-Roger Waters comeback single \\'Learning to Fly.\\' The guitarist was tardy because he was indeed taking flying lessons. 18 Tours in the late \\'80s and early \\'90s didn\\'t often delve into the band\\'s pre-\\'Dark Side\\' material, because David Gilmour felt the lyrical content hadn\\'t aged well. \"Dave didn\\'t really feel comfortable singing about albatrosses and sunshine,\" Nick Mason said. 19 The opening night of Pink Floyd\\'s record-smashing series of 1994 London dates at Earl\\'s Court on \\'The Division Bell\\' tour ended up narrowly avoiding disaster when a 1,200-seat stand collapsed as they took the stage. Miraculously, no one was hurt. 20 Some people have suggested that Richard Wright\\'s 2008 death put an end to hopes for another Pink Floyd reunion with Roger Waters. But David Gilmour put an end to that before then, He said there wouldn\\'t be any more reunions after their Live 8 show in 2005. \"It\\'s in the past for me,\" he said. \"Done it. I don\\'t have any desire to go back there.\" Pink Floyd\\'s upcoming album, \\'Endless River,\\' does not include Waters. BONUS You Think You Know Pink Floyd?

Music Film Travel Art Music Film Travel Art #Oscars2024 (Credits: Far Out / Pink Floyd) Music » From The Vault Who sang lead vocals on the Pink Floyd song ‘Have a Cigar’? Tyler Golsen @TylerGolsen Mon 18 September 2023 13:15, UK Bringing in outside help was never an issue for Pink Floyd . The four-man progressive rock outfit had plenty of self-sufficiency during their biggest years, with three singers at their disposal in the form of David Gilmour, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright. But every once in a while, the band needed someone else to take over the vocals. Clare Torre did a fantastic job in that regard on ‘The Great Gig in the Sky’ from The Dark Side of the Moon. And in 1975, the band once again needed a ringer. It was during the sessions for Wish You Were Here that work stalled on ‘Have a Cigar’. The sarcastic and poison-tipped ode to music executives who were more than happy to make big bucks off the band’s music, ‘Have a Cigar’, needed a certain panache that none of the band members could seem to get right. Waters was initially the song’s vocalist, but his takes proved to be insufficient. “Roger had a go at singing it, and one or two people were unkind about his singing,” David Gilmour recalled to Mojo in 2011. “One or two people then asked me to have a go at it. I did, but I wasn’t comfortable. I had nothing against the lyrics. Maybe the range and intensity wasn’t right for my voice.” With neither of the band’s two main vocalists doing the song justice, it was up to someone else to bring the greedy executive who narrated the song to life. The answer came in the form of Roy Harper, the eccentric English folk singer who had previously shared a label with Pink Floyd. Harper was at EMI Studios simultaneously and hovering around the recording, looking for his chance to contribute. “I can distinctly remember Roy leaning on the wall outside Abbey Road while we were nattering away and (growls) ‘Go on, lemme have a go, lemme have a go.’ We all went, ‘Shut up, Roy,\\'” Gilmour added. “But eventually we said, ‘Go on then, Roy, have your bloody go.’ Most of us enjoyed his version, though I don’t think Roger ever liked it.” “A lot of people think I can’t sing, including me a bit,” Waters claimed in 1975. “I’m very unclear about what singing is. I know I find it hard to pitch, and I know the sound of my voice isn’t very good in purely aesthetic terms, and Roy Harper was recording his own album in another EMI studio at the time; he’s a mate, and we thought he could probably do a job on it.” Harper took on a flamboyant affectation while singing the track, milking the song’s bitter sentiments for all it was worth. Rogers wasn’t always comfortable with the theatric way Harper spit out the lyrics, with the bassist feeling that Harper had almost turned the song into a parody. On the other side, Gilmour believed that Harper’s clownish performance accurately represented some of the figures that floated around the band at the time. “We did have people who would say to us ‘Which one’s Pink?’ and stuff like that,” Gilmour claimed in 1992. “There were an awful lot of people who thought Pink Floyd was the name of the lead singer, and that was Pink himself and the band. That’s how it all came about, it was quite genuine.” Check out ‘Have a Cigar’ down below.

You can keep on reading to find out what happened to the lead singer of Pink Floyd . About The Lead Singer Of Pink Floyd Syd Barrett was the original frontman and primary songwriter of Pink Floyd. He was well known for his whimsical style of psychedelia, English-accented singing, and stream-of-consciousness writing style. Being a guitarist, Roger was influential for his free-form playing and for employing effects. This included dissonance, distortion, echo, and feedback. Roger was originally trained as a painter! He was musically active for less than 10 years. He recorded four singles and several unreleased songs with Pink Floyd. Syd was ousted from the band due to mental illness and his excessive usage of psychedelic drugs in 1968. Pink Floyd’s original name was The Megadeaths but was then renamed after Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. This rock band sold more than 250 million records worldwide! This made them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The records “The Dard Side of the Moon” and “The Wall” were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In fact, four Pink Floyd albums even topped the US Billboard 200. Whereas five albums topped the UK Album Chart. In 1969, Barrett started his solo career with the single Octopus . He even released the albums The Madcap Laughs and Barrett which was recorded with the aid of several members of Pink Floyd. Later, in 1972, Barrett left the music industry, retired from public life, and guarded his privacy until his death. During this time, he continued painting and dedicated his time to gardening. The lead singer of Pink Floyd died due to pancreatic cancer at the age of 60 in Cambridge. His funeral was held at Cambridge Crematorium on 18th July 2006. Surprisingly, no original Pink Floyd members attended his funeral. Even NME paid a tribute issue to Barrett a week later after his death with a photo of him on the cover. His sister Rosemary Breen revealed that he wrote an unpublished book about the history of art. According to research, Barrett left £1.7 million to his four siblings. He mostly earned royalties from Pink Floyd compilations and live recordings featuring Barrett’s songs. Rosemary even told that he took a keen interest in art and horticulture. He further continued to devote himself to painting. Barrett was in a relationship with several women including Libby Gausden, Lindsay Korner, and Jenny Spires. One of his girlfriends was Pakistani-born named Evelyn Rose. Evelyn even appeared on the back cover of The Madcap Laughs. Syd never got married or had children. Many people believe that he was briefly engaged to marry Gayla Pinion. The couple even planned to relocate to Oxford. Visit Singerbio and read everything about the singer.

Most Pink Floyd songs, though, have David Gilmour or Roger Waters on lead, while some have Richard Wright. On a few rare occasions, Nick Mason sang lead.

But it would also mark the last time Pink Floyd’s core members – Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright – would record an album together.

He was 60. His death was confirmed by a spokesman for his former band, Doug Wright of LD Communications, who did not give a cause. Mr. Barrett had long suffered from diabetes. A statement from Mr. Wright said: “The band are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett’s death. Syd was the guiding light of the early band lineup and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire.” With Pink Floyd, and on two haunting solo albums, Mr. Barrett became a touchstone for experimental pop musicians. He was also renowned both as an LSD casualty and as a symbol of how close creativity can be to madness. Mr. Barrett wrote most of the songs on Pink Floyd’s debut album, “The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.” In Mr. Barrett’s songs like “Astronomy Domine,” whimsy and wordplay merged with a playful sense of structure and sound. “Let’s try it another way/You’ll lose your mind and play,” he wrote in “See Emily Play.” He also helped to conceive the band’s performances as spectacles. “We have only just started to scrape the surface of effects and ideas of lights and music combined,” Mr. Barrett told the trade newspaper Melody Maker in 1967. But under the pressures of rock stardom and after frequent use of LSD, Mr. Barrett had a breakdown in the late 1960’s and spent most of his life as a recluse. Pink Floyd, with its bassist, Roger Waters, taking over as songwriter, went on to become a multimillion-selling arena-rock band in the 1970’s. Pink Floyd sang about Mr. Barrett in one of its hits, “Shine On You Crazy Diamond.” Roger Keith Barrett, nicknamed Syd as a teenager, was born in Cambridge, England, on Jan. 6, 1946. He played the piano as a child and then took up the guitar, joining his first band at 16. Pink Floyd began with boyhood friendships. Mr. Barrett attended the same elementary school as Mr. Waters. David Gilmour, who eventually replaced him as Pink Floyd’s guitarist, was another teenage friend. Image Pink Floyd in March 1967. From left, Roger Waters, Nick Mason, Syd Barrett and Rick Wright. Drug use left Mr. Barrett unable to play, and the next year he was out of the band. He later recorded two solo albums. Credit... Press Association, via Associated Press In 1965, while Mr. Barrett studied painting and fine art at Camberwell art school in South London, Mr. Waters, the drummer Nick Mason and the keyboardist Rick Wright were studying architecture at Regent Street Polytechnic. They recruited Mr. Barrett to join their blues band. Mr. Barrett combined the first names of two bluesmen, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council, to name the group Pink Floyd. Blues-rock soon receded in Pink Floyd’s music, giving way to songs that built on the Beatles’ pop innovations and the expanded perceptions of the 1960’s. The music followed Mr. Barrett’s lyrics through meter changes, improbable interludes and the otherworldly sound effects the band was generating onstage at London clubs like UFO, a bastion of psychedelia. Mr. Barrett used an echo machine and slid a Zippo lighter along his guitar strings to create one of Pink Floyd’s sonic signatures. In early 1967, Pink Floyd signed to EMI Records. Its first two singles \\x97 “Arnold Layne,” a fond song about a transvestite, and “See Emily Play” \\x97 reached the British Top 20. Pink Floyd made its debut album at Abbey Road Studios, as the Beatles worked on “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” next door. “The Piper at the Gates of Dawn” was a definitive psychedelic album. Its songs mixed childlike wonder with portents of disaster, and its music veered off on exuberant tangents before returning to pop choruses. Onstage, the music was more free-form and anarchic. Band members have said Mr. Barrett was unstable even before he began extensive drug use, and he developed a reputation for odd behavior. For one show, he tried to slick down his hair with a combination of Brylcreem and crushed Mandrax tranquilizer pills, which were melted by stage lights and started to ooze down his face as he played. Playing the Fillmore West on Pink Floyd’s 1967 American tour, Mr. Barrett stood staring into space and detuning the strings on his guitar. The band cut short its American tour. During 1967, Mr. Barrett was taking LSD every day, and that often left him incapable of performing. Mr. Gilmour joined Pink Floyd late in 1967, and by the spring of 1968, Mr. Barrett was out of the band. He wrote the song that closes “A Saucerful of Secrets,” Pink Floyd’s second album: “Jugband Blues,” which includes a Salvation Army band playing on one section. “It’s awfully considerate of you to think of me here,” he sang, “and I’m most obliged to you for making it clear/that I’m not here.” Without Mr. Barrett, Pink Floyd’s music changed. Whimsy gave way to majestic anthems on best-selling albums like “Dark Side of the Moon,” a concept album about insanity. Mr. Barrett was treated in psychiatric hospitals and quietly began recording songs and fragments of songs. Some were solo recordings with an acoustic guitar that other musicians were brought in to accompany; others were recorded with fellow musicians in the studio, or with Mr. Barrett working over finished backup tracks. The irregular structures of Mr. Barrett’s songs frustrated studio musicians and various producers, but Mr. Waters and Mr. Gilmour eventually took over production and completed “The Madcap Laughs,” released in January 1970. Mr. Gilmour and Mr. Barrett returned to the studio to make “Barrett,” released in November 1970. On both albums, Mr. Barrett sounds fragile but oddly serene, following his rhymes whether they lead to nonsense or revelation. Mr. Barrett appeared on BBC Radio and played one brief show at the London Olympia in 1970 (accompanied by Mr. Gilmour), walking offstage after four songs. In 1972, he made a last attempt to lead a band, Stars, which played a half-dozen shows in England before disbanding. Recording sessions in 1974 were unproductive. Since then, Mr. Barrett lived quietly, spending some of his time painting. He showed up at unlikely moments: he appeared unannounced, for instance, at a 1975 Pink Floyd session as the band recorded “Shine On, You Crazy Diamond.” A British magazine reported that he was institutionalized for two years in the early 1980’s. Outtakes from his solo albums were released in 1988 as “Opel,” and a boxed set collecting all three solo albums, “Crazy Diamond,” was released in 1993. He learned he had Type II diabetes in 1998. Mr. Barrett’s survivors include a brother, Alan, and a sister, Rosemary. For someone with such a brief career, Mr. Barrett has never been forgotten. Indie-rockers have long tried to emulate his twisted craftsmanship, paying tribute in songs like Television Personalities’ “I Know Where Syd Barrett Lives.” Sir Tom Stoppard’s new play, “Rock ’n’ Roll,” invokes him as a lost free spirit.

The group was founded in late 1965 by Syd Barrett on guitar and lead vocals, Nick Mason on drums, Roger Waters on bass and vocals, and Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals. Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour would later join the band in December 1967, while Barrett was ousted from the band in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health . From the 1970s onwards, they were augmented by additional personnel in the studio and on stage. Following creative tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1981, followed by Waters in 1985. Wright rejoined as a session musician and, later, band member. Mason is the only member to appear on all studio releases.

Background information Origin Liverpool , United Kingdom Genres Progressive rock , psychedelic rock Years active 2011–present Members Damian Darlington Edo Scordo Gareth Darlington Bryan Kolupski Matt Riddle Ian Cattell Arran Ahmun Eva Avila Jenn Kee Ryan Saranich Andrea Pellegrini Robyn Cage Ella Chi Randy Cooke Past members Amy Smith Jay Davidson Rosalee O\\'Connell Carl Brunsdon Ola Bienkowska Emily Jollands Angela Cervantes Thomas Ashbrook Rob Stringer Roberta Freeman Bobby Harrison Website www.britfloydofficial.com Brit Floyd is a Pink Floyd tribute band formed in 2011 in Liverpool , United Kingdom [1] by Damian Darlington. History [ edit ] Brit Floyd originated in 2011 on the initiative of guitarist and singer Damian Darlington \"simply because he felt he could do it one better\" than his previous band, The Australian Pink Floyd Show . He continued: \"There is much more attention to details in every aspect of the show, from the music to the visuals to the lighting. Everything is that much more perfected and there\\'s a passion coming off that stage ... It\\'s a coherent, emotional journey through Pink Floyd \\'s catalog.\" [2] Darlington began following Pink Floyd\\'s work after hearing The Wall at the age of 13 and he saw the band live for the first time in 1988 during the A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour . [3] \"Since then, he has seen the band in 1994 and in different incarnations, after its split, including its 2005 reunion.\" [3] Pink Floyd saxophonist and rhythm guitar player Scott Page, during a surprise guest performance with Brit Floyd in 2015. Regarding his growing up listening to the band, Darlington stated: \"I definitely listened to Pink Floyd. I remember \\' Another Brick in the Wall \\' being No. 1 in the UK. It was December 1979. Probably my first memory of Pink Floyd. Then I actually heard The Wall album in its entirety and that\\'s what particularly drew me to Pink Floyd about the age of 12 or 13. I was fascinated by the record that told a story, and all these sound effects linking songs together, and also the wonderful guitar work. I was already learning to play guitar and I wanted to learn to play some of these wonderful guitar solos. That was my introduction to Pink Floyd. I was a fan from quite an early age.\" [2] After playing in a number of bands over the years covering a wide range of music including country , western , and even jazz , Darlington played with The Australian Pink Floyd Show from 1994 to 2011 (Darlington is not the only veteran of The Australian Pink Floyd Show in Brit Floyd, \"several others in Brit Floyd\" have been a part of the band as well). [4] Darlington wanted to parlay his experience with The Australian Pink Floyd Show into something more nuanced: “I felt it was time to do it in a different way with a different group of musicians — to strike out on my own, I’ve had a lot of experience and have learned how to do this correctly.” [3] Darlington says the show pays greater attention to detail, presenting a more polished show: “If you’ve seen the Australian show, you’ll notice a difference in a big way — a difference for the better, we make the extra effort to re-create as much as we can and it’s not just the songs: It’s the visuals, as well.” [3] The Band has toured extensively since 2011 and has featured guest musicians from Pink Floyd\\'s studio and touring band line-ups. Pink Floyd bass player and vocalist Guy Pratt joined Brit Floyd on stage at Echo Arena Liverpool on 9 November 2013, and saxophonist and rhythm guitarist Scott Page joined them at Los Angeles \\'s Orpheum Theatre on 17 June 2015, playing \" Money \" and \" Us and Them \" with the band. [5] [6] In 2016 the band embarked on \"a massive 76-date US tour\" featuring \"an extended career-spanning setlist\" that included a performance of Pink Floyd’s 24-minute epic \" Echoes \" and featured a \"million dollar stage design.\" [7] At the conclusion of their 2022 world tour, a press release announced that Brit Floyd had parted ways with their longtime management (a small British production company called CMP Entertainment) and partnered with Palladium Entertainment. Due to the split, the band made new social media profiles along with a brand new website. With the announcement of the management change, the band also confirmed their plans for a 2023 world tour celebrating the 50th anniversary of Pink Floyd\\'s 1973 album, The Dark Side of The Moon.

[1] George Roger Waters (born 6 September 1943) is an English musician and singer-songwriter. In 1965, he co-founded the rock band Pink Floyd as the bassist. Following the departure of the songwriter, Syd Barrett , in 1968, Waters became Pink Floyd\\'s lyricist, co-lead vocalist and conceptual leader until his departure in 1985. Pink Floyd achieved international success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979), and The Final Cut (1983). By the early 1980s, they had become one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups in popular music. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute over the use of the band\\'s name and material. They settled out of court in 1987. Waters\\'s solo work includes the studio albums The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984), Radio K.A.O.S. (1987) , Amused to Death (1992) , and Is This the Life We Really Want? (2017). In 2005, he released Ça Ira , an opera translated from Étienne and Nadine Roda-Gils\\' libretto about the French Revolution . In 1990, Waters staged one of the largest rock concerts in history, The Wall\\xa0– Live in Berlin , with an attendance of 450,000. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. Later that year, he reunited with Pink Floyd for the Live 8 global awareness event, the group\\'s only appearance with Waters since 1981. He has toured extensively as a solo act since 1999. He performed The Dark Side of the Moon for his world tour of 2006–2008 , and The Wall Live , his tour of 2010–2013, was the highest-grossing tour by a solo artist at the time . Waters incorporates political themes in his work and is a prominent pro-Palestinian activist with regards to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict . He has called for the removal of the Israeli West Bank Barrier and supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel. He has described Israel\\'s treatment of Palestinians as apartheid . Some of his comments, such as his likening of Israel to Nazi Germany , and elements of his live shows, have been accused of being anti-Semitic . He has dismissed the accusations as a conflation of anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism . Early years Waters was born on 6 September 1943, the younger of two boys, to Mary (née Whyte; 1913–2009) and Eric Fletcher Waters (1914–1944), in Great Bookham , Surrey . [2] His father, the son of a coal miner and Labour Party activist, was a schoolteacher, a devout Christian, and a Communist Party member. [3] In the early years of the Second World War , Waters\\' father was a conscientious objector who drove an ambulance during the Blitz . [3] He later changed his stance on pacifism , joined the Territorial Army and was commissioned into the 8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers as a Second Lieutenant on 11 September 1943. [4] He was killed five months later on 18 February 1944 at Aprilia , during the Battle of Anzio , when Roger was five months old. [5] He is commemorated in Aprilia and at the Cassino War Cemetery . [6] On 18 February 2014, Waters unveiled a monument to his father and other war casualties in Aprilia, Italy and was made an honorary citizen of Anzio. [7] Following her husband\\'s death, Mary Waters, also a teacher, moved with her two sons to Cambridge and raised them there. [8] Waters\\' earliest memory is of the V-J Day celebrations. [9] Waters attended Morley Memorial Junior School in Cambridge and then the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (now Hills Road Sixth Form College ) with Syd Barrett . [10] The future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour lived nearby on Mill Road and attended the Perse School . [11] At 15, Waters was chairman of the Cambridge Youth Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (YCND), [12] having designed its publicity poster and participated in its organisation. [13] He was a keen sportsman and a highly regarded member of the high school\\'s cricket and rugby teams. [14] Waters was unhappy at school, saying: \"I hated every second of it, apart from games. The regime at school was a very oppressive one\\xa0... The same kids who are susceptible to bullying by other kids are also susceptible to bullying by the teachers.\" [15] Waters met future Pink Floyd members Nick Mason and Richard Wright in London, at the Regent Street Polytechnic (later the University of Westminster ) School of Architecture. Waters enrolled there in 1962, after a series of aptitude tests indicated he was well suited to that field. [16] He had initially considered a career in mechanical engineering. [17] 1965–1985: Pink Floyd Main article: Pink Floyd Formation and Barrett-led period Waters performing with Pink Floyd at Leeds University in 1970 By September 1963, Waters and Mason had lost interest in their studies and moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic. [18] Waters, Mason and Wright first played music together in late 1963, in a band formed by vocalist Keith Noble and bassist Clive Metcalfe. [19] They usually called themselves Sigma\\xa06, but also used the name the Meggadeaths. [13] Waters played rhythm guitar, Mason played drums, Wright played any keyboard he could arrange to use, and Noble\\'s sister Sheilagh provided occasional vocals. [20] In the early years the band performed during private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of Regent Street Polytechnic. [21] When Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own group in September 1963, the remaining members asked Barrett and the guitarist Bob Klose to join. [22] Waters switched to the bass. By January 1964, the group became known as the Abdabs, or the Screaming Abdabs. [23] During late 1964, the band used the names Leonard\\'s Lodgers, Spectrum Five, and eventually, the Tea Set. [24] In late 1965, the Tea Set had changed their name to the Pink Floyd Sound, later the Pink Floyd Blues Band and, by early 1966, Pink Floyd. [25] By early 1966, Barrett was Pink Floyd\\'s frontman, guitarist, and songwriter. [26] He wrote or co-wrote all but one track of their debut LP The Piper at the Gates of Dawn , released in August 1967. [27] Waters contributed the song \" Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk \" (his first sole writing credit) to the album. [28] By late 1967, Barrett\\'s deteriorating mental health and increasingly erratic behaviour [29] rendered him \"unable or unwilling\" [30] to continue in his capacity as Pink Floyd\\'s songwriter and lead guitarist. [27] In early March 1968, to discuss the band\\'s future, Barrett, Mason, Waters, and Wright met with the band\\'s managers, Peter Jenner and Andrew King , of the rock music management company they had all founded, Blackhill Enterprises . Barrett agreed to leave Pink Floyd, and the band \"agreed to Blackhill\\'s entitlement in perpetuity\" regarding \"past activities\". [31] Their new manager, Steve O\\'Rourke , made a formal announcement about the departure of Barrett and the arrival of Gilmour in April 1968. [32] Waters-led period A live performance of The Dark Side of the Moon at Earls Court Exhibition Centre , shortly after its release in 1973: (l–r) David Gilmour, Nick Mason, Dick Parry , Roger Waters After Barrett\\'s departure in March 1968, Waters began to chart Pink Floyd\\'s artistic direction. [33] In 1970, he composed – in collaboration with Ron Geesin – Music from The Body , a soundtrack for Roy Battersby \\'s documentary The Body . [34] [35] Waters said he wanted to \"drag [Pink Floyd] kicking and screaming back from the borders of space, from the whimsy that Syd was into, to my concerns, which were much more political and philosophical\". [36] He became a dominant songwriter and the band\\'s principal lyricist, sharing lead vocals with Gilmour and sometimes Wright. Throughout the late 1970s, he was the band\\'s dominant creative figure until his departure in 1985. [33] He wrote most of the lyrics to the five Pink Floyd albums preceding his departure, starting with The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) and ending with The Final Cut (1983), while exerting progressively more creative control. Every Waters studio album from The Dark Side of the Moon onwards has been a concept album . [37] With lyrics entirely by Waters, The Dark Side of the Moon is one of the most successful rock albums ever. It spent 736 consecutive weeks on the Billboard 200 chart—until July 1988—and sold over 40 million copies worldwide. As of 2005, it continued to sell over 8,000 copies a week. [38] According to Pink Floyd biographer Glenn Povey, Dark Side of the Moon is the world\\'s second-bestselling album and the United States\\' 21st-bestselling album. [39] In 2006, asked if he felt his goals for Dark Side had been accomplished, Waters said: When the record was finished I took a reel-to-reel copy home with me and I remember playing it for my wife then, and I remember her bursting into tears when it was finished. And I thought, \"This has obviously struck a chord somewhere,\" and I was kinda pleased by that. You know when you’ve done something, certainly if you create a piece of music, you then hear it with fresh ears when you play it for somebody else. And at that point I thought to myself, \"Wow, this is a pretty complete piece of work,\" and I had every confidence that people would respond to it. [40] Waters\\' thematic ideas became the impetus for the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979) — written largely by Waters — and The Final Cut (1983), written entirely by him. [41] The cost of war and the loss of his father became a recurring theme, from \" Corporal Clegg \" ( A Saucerful of Secrets , 1968) and \" Free Four \" ( Obscured by Clouds , 1972) to \" Us and Them \" from The Dark Side of the Moon , \" When the Tigers Broke Free \", first used in the feature film The Wall (1982), later included with \" The Fletcher Memorial Home \" on The Final Cut , an album dedicated to his father. [42] The theme and composition of The Wall was influenced by his upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War. [43] The Wall , written almost entirely by Waters, is largely based on his life story. [44] Having sold over 23\\xa0million RIAA certified units in the US as of 2013, is tied for sixth-most certified album of all time in America. [45] Pink Floyd hired Bob Ezrin to co-produce the album and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe to illustrate the sleeve art. [46] They embarked on The Wall Tour of Los Angeles, New York, London, and Dortmund. The last Pink Floyd performance of The Wall was on 17 June 1981, at Earls Court London, and this was Pink Floyd\\'s last appearance with Waters until the band\\'s brief reunion at 2 July 2005 Live 8 concert in London\\'s Hyde Park, 24 years later. [47] In March 1983, the last Pink Floyd album with Waters, The Final Cut , was released. It was subtitled: \"A requiem for the post-war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd\". [48] Waters wrote all the album\\'s lyrics and music. His lyrics were critical of the Conservative Party government of the day and mention Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher by name. [49] At the time Gilmour did not have any new material, so he asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. [50] According to Mason, after power struggles within the band and creative arguments about the album, Gilmour\\'s name \"disappeared\" from the production credits, though he retained his pay. [51] Rolling Stone gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder describing it as \"a superlative achievement\" and \"art rock\\'s crowning masterpiece\". [52] Loder viewed the work as \"essentially a Roger Waters solo album\". [53] Departure and legal battles Amidst creative differences, Waters left Pink Floyd in 1985 and began a legal battle with the band regarding their continued use of the name and material. [54] In December 1985, Waters issued a statement to EMI and CBS invoking the \"Leaving Member\" clause in his contract. In October 1986, he initiated High Court proceedings to formally dissolve the Pink Floyd partnership. In his submission to the High Court he called Pink Floyd a \"spent force creatively\". [55] Gilmour and Mason opposed the application and announced their intention to continue as Pink Floyd. Waters said he had been forced to resign like Barrett had been years earlier, and decided to leave Pink Floyd based on legal considerations, saying: \"If I hadn\\'t, the financial repercussions would have wiped me out completely.\" [56] Waters did not want the band to use the name Pink Floyd without him. He said later: \"I would be distressed if Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr made records and went on the road calling themselves the Beatles . If John Lennon \\'s not in it, it\\'s sacrilegious ... To continue with Gilmour and Mason, getting in a whole bunch of other people to write the material, seems to me an insult to the work that came before.\" [57] In December 1987, Waters and Pink Floyd reached an agreement. [54] Waters was released from his contractual obligation with O\\'Rourke, and he retained the copyrights to the Wall concept and the inflatable Animals pig. [58] Pink Floyd released three studio albums without him: A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987), The Division Bell (1994) and The Endless River (2014). [59] According to a 1999 interview with Gilmour, Waters declined an invitation to perform The Dark Side of the Moon with Pink Floyd at Earls Court , London. [57] In 2005, Waters said the period of his departure had been a \"bad, negative time\", and that he regretted his part in the negativity: \"Why should I have imposed my feeling about the work and what it was worth on the others if they didn\\'t feel the same? I was wrong in attempting to do that.\" [60] In 2013, Waters said he regretted the lawsuit and had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the band members. [61] 1984–present: solo career 1984–1989: The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking and Radio K.A.O.S. The Wall\\xa0– Live in Berlin , 21 July 1990 In 1984, Waters released his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking , which dealt with Waters\\'s feelings about monogamy and family life versus \"the call of the wild\". [62] The protagonist, Reg, finally chooses love and matrimony over promiscuity. The album featured guitarist Eric Clapton , jazz saxophonist David Sanborn , and artwork by Gerald Scarfe. [62] Kurt Loder described The Pros And Cons of Hitch Hiking as a \"strangely static, faintly hideous record\". [63] Rolling Stone rated the album a \"rock bottom one star\". [62] Years later, Mike DeGagne of AllMusic praised its \"ingenious symbolism\" and \"brilliant use of stream of consciousness within a subconscious realm\", rating it four out of five. [64] Waters toured the album with Clapton, a new band, and new material; the shows included a selection of Pink Floyd songs. Waters débuted his tour in Stockholm on 16 June 1984. The tour drew poor ticket sales and some performances at larger venues were cancelled; [65] Waters estimated that he lost £400,000 on the tour. [66] In March 1985, Waters went to North America to play smaller venues with the Pros and Cons Plus Some Old Pink Floyd Stuff—North America Tour 1985. The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking has been certified Gold by the RIAA. [67] In 1986, Waters contributed songs and a score to the soundtrack of the animated film When the Wind Blows , based on the Raymond Briggs book of the same name . His backing band featuring Paul Carrack was credited as The Bleeding Heart Band . [68] In 1987, Waters released Radio K.A.O.S. , a concept album based on a mute man named Billy from an impoverished Welsh mining town who has the ability to physically tune into radio waves in his head. Billy learns to communicate with a radio DJ, and eventually to control the world\\'s computers. Angry at the state of the world in which he lives, he simulates a nuclear attack. Waters followed the release with a supporting tour also in 1987. [69] 1989–1999: The Wall – Live in Berlin and Amused to Death In November 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, and in July 1990 Waters staged one of the largest and most elaborate rock concerts in history, [70] The Wall\\xa0– Live in Berlin , on the vacant terrain between Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg Gate . The show reported an attendance of 200,000, though some estimates are as much as twice that, with approximately one billion television viewers. [71] Leonard Cheshire asked Waters to perform the concert to raise funds for charity. Waters\\'s musicians included Joni Mitchell , Van Morrison , Cyndi Lauper , Bryan Adams , Scorpions , and Sinéad O\\'Connor . Waters also used an East German symphony orchestra and choir, a Soviet marching band, and a pair of helicopters from the US 7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron . Designed by Mark Fisher, the wall was 25\\xa0metres tall and 170\\xa0metres long and was built across the set, and Scarfe\\'s inflatable puppets were recreated on an enlarged scale. Many rock icons received invitations to the show, though Gilmour, Mason, and Wright did not. [72] Waters released a double album of the performance, which has been certified platinum by the RIAA. [67] In 1990, Waters hired manager Mark Fenwick and left EMI for a worldwide deal with Columbia. He released his third studio album, Amused to Death , in 1992. The record was influenced heavily by the events of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the Gulf War , and a critique of the notion of war becoming the subject of entertainment, particularly on television. The title was derived from the book Amusing Ourselves to Death by Neil Postman . Patrick Leonard , who worked on A Momentary Lapse of Reason , co-produced the album. Jeff Beck played lead guitar on many of the album\\'s tracks, which were recorded with a cast of musicians at ten different recording studios. [73] It is Waters\\'s most critically acclaimed solo recording, garnering comparison to his work with Pink Floyd. [74] Waters described the record as a \"stunning piece of work\", ranking it alongside Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall as one of the best of his career. [75] The song \" What God Wants , Pt. 1\" reached number 35 in the UK in September 1992 and number 5 on Billboard \\' s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the US. [76] Amused to Death was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry . [77] Sales of Amused to Death topped out at around one million and there was no tour in support of the album. Waters would first perform material from it seven years later during his In the Flesh tour . [78] In 1996, Waters was inducted into the US and UK Rock and Roll Halls of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd. [79] 1999–2004: In the Flesh tour and Wall Broadway production In 1999, after a 12-year hiatus from touring and a seven-year absence from the music industry, Waters embarked on the In the Flesh tour, performing both solo and Pink Floyd material. The tour was a financial success in the US; though Waters had booked mostly smaller venues, tickets sold so well that many of the concerts were upgraded to larger ones. [80] The tour eventually stretched across the world and spanned three years. A concert film was released on CD and DVD, In the Flesh – Live . During the tour, Waters played two new songs \"Flickering Flame\" and \"Each Small Candle\" as the final encore to many of the shows. In June 2002, he completed the tour with a performance in front of 70,000 people at the Glastonbury Festival of Performing Arts , playing 15 Pink Floyd songs and five songs from his solo catalogue. [80] Miramax announced in 2004 that a production of The Wall was to appear on Broadway with Waters playing a prominent role in the creative direction. Reports stated that the musical contained not only the original tracks from The Wall , but also songs from Dark Side of the Moon , Wish You Were Here and other Pink Floyd albums, as well as new material. [81] On the night of 1 May 2004, recorded extracts from the opera, including its overture , were played on the occasion of the Welcome Europe celebrations in the accession country of Malta . Gert Hof mixed recorded excerpts from the opera into a continuous piece of music which was played as an accompaniment to a large light and fireworks display over Grand Harbour in Valletta . [82] In July 2004, Waters released two new tracks online: \"To Kill the Child\", inspired by the 2003 invasion of Iraq , and \"Leaving Beirut\", an anti-war song inspired by his travels in the Middle East as a teenager. [83] 2005: Pink Floyd reunion and Ça Ira Waters (far right) performing with Pink Floyd at Live 8, 2 July 2005 Waters playing \"In the Flesh\" on his Dark Side of the Moon Tour at Viking Stadion, Stavanger, 26 June 2006 In July 2005, Waters reunited with Mason, Wright, and Gilmour for their final performance together at the 2005 Live 8 concert in London\\'s Hyde Park, Pink Floyd\\'s only appearance with Waters since their final performance of The Wall at Earls Court London 24 years earlier. [84] They played a 23-minute set consisting of \" Speak to Me / Breathe \"/\" Breathe (Reprise) \", \" Money \", \" Wish You Were Here \", and \" Comfortably Numb \". Waters told the Associated Press that while the experience of playing with Pink Floyd again was positive, the chances of a bona fide reunion would be \"slight\" considering his and Gilmour\\'s continuing musical and ideological differences. [85] Though Waters had differing ideas about which songs they should play, he \"agreed to roll over for one night only\". [86] In November 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend of the Who . [87] In September 2005, Waters released Ça Ira (pronounced [sa iˈʁa] , French for \"it will be fine\"; Waters added the subtitle, \"There is Hope\"), an opera in three acts translated from the late Étienne Roda-Gil \\'s French libretto based on the historical subject of the French Revolution . [88] Ça Ira was released as a double CD album, featuring baritone Bryn Terfel , soprano Ying Huang and tenor Paul Groves . [89] Set during the early French Revolution, the original libretto was co-written in French by Roda-Gil and his wife Nadine Delahaye. Waters had begun rewriting the libretto in English in 1989, [90] and said about the composition: \"I\\'ve always been a big fan of Beethoven\\'s choral music, Berlioz and Borodin ...\\xa0This is unashamedly romantic and resides in that early 19th-century tradition, because that\\'s where my tastes lie in classical and choral music.\" [91] Waters appeared on television to discuss the opera, but the interviews often focused on his relationship with Pink Floyd, something Waters would \"take in stride\", a sign Pink Floyd biographer Mark Blake believes is \"a testament to his mellower old age or twenty years of dedicated psychotherapy\". [91] Ça Ira reached number 5 on the Billboard Classical Music Chart in the United States. [92] 2006–2009: The Dark Side of the Moon Live In June 2006, Waters began the two-year Dark Side of the Moon Live world tour. The first half of the show featured both Pink Floyd songs and Waters\\'s solo material; the second included a complete performance of The Dark Side of the Moon , the first time in more than three decades that Waters had performed it. The shows ended with an encore from the third side of The Wall . The elaborate staging, by the concert lighting designer Marc Brickman , included laser lights, fog machines, pyrotechnics, psychedelic projections, and inflatable floating puppets (Spaceman and Pig) controlled by a \"handler\" dressed as a butcher, and a full 360-degree quadraphonic sound system. Mason joined Waters for the Dark Side of the Moon set and the encores on some 2006 performances. [93] In March 2007, the Waters song \" Hello (I Love You) \" featured in the science fiction film The Last Mimzy . Waters released it as a single, on CD and via download, and described it as \"a song that captures the themes of the movie, the clash between humanity\\'s best and worst instincts, and how a child\\'s innocence can win the day\". [94] He performed at California\\'s Coachella Festival in April 2008 and was to be among the headlining artists at Live Earth 2008 in Mumbai, India, in December 2008, [95] but the concert was cancelled following the 26 November terrorist attacks in Mumbai. [96] In April 2008, Waters discussed a possible new album with the tentative name Heartland . [97] 2010s: The Wall Live and Is This the Life We Really Want? Waters in Barcelona during The Wall Live in 2011 In June 2010, Waters released a cover of \" We Shall Overcome \", a protest song rewritten and arranged by Guy Carawan and Pete Seeger . He performed with Gilmour at the Hoping Foundation Benefit Evening in July 2010. [98] The set comprised a cover of the Phil Spector song \" To Know Him Is to Love Him \", which was played in early Pink Floyd soundchecks, followed by \"Wish You Were Here\", \"Comfortably Numb\", and \" Another Brick in the Wall (Part Two) \". [99] In September 2010, Waters began the Wall Live tour, an updated version of the original Pink Floyd tour, featuring a complete performance of The Wall . [100] At the O2 Arena in London on 12 May 2011, Gilmour and Mason again performed with Waters on \"Comfortably Numb\", and \"Outside the Wall\". [101] For the first half of 2012, the tour topped worldwide concert ticket sales, having sold more than 1.4 million tickets globally. [102] By 2013, the Wall Live had become the highest-grossing tour by a solo artist . [103] Waters performed at the Concert for Sandy Relief at Madison Square Garden on 12 December 2012. [104] On 24 July 2015, he headlined the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, Rhode Island , accompanied by the band My Morning Jacket and two singers from the group Lucius . [105] Waters performed at the Desert Trip festival in October 2016. [106] Waters performed a series of concerts in Mexico City in October 2016 Waters released his first solo album in nearly 25 years, Is This the Life We Really Want? , on 2 June 2017. [107] It was produced by the Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich . Godrich was a fan of Waters\\' work with Pink Floyd, but was critical of his solo work and encouraged him to make a concise album showcasing his lyrics. [108] [109] Waters returned to North America in 2017 with the Us + Them Tour , performing Pink Floyd and solo material. [110] On 26 October 2018, Sony Classical Masterworks released an adaptation of Igor Stravinsky\\'s theatrical work The Soldier\\'s Tale narrated by Waters. [111] On 18 April 2019, Waters joined Nick Mason\\'s Saucerful of Secrets on stage at the Beacon Theatre to sing \" Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun \". [112] Waters was one of the ten highest-grossing concert acts of the decade. [113] 2020s: This is Not a Drill, Pink Floyd disputes and The Dark Side of the Moon Redux In January 2020, Waters announced a new arena tour, This Is Not a Drill , that would tour North America and finish one month before the 2020 presidential election . [114] The tour was rescheduled to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic . [115] [116] The concerts were held from July to October 2022, [117] and expanded with dates in Europe from March to June 2023. [118] In 2021, Waters said he had begun writing a memoir during the pandemic. [119] In December 2022, he released an EP, The Lockdown Sessions , comprising six new versions of songs from his solo career and Pink Floyd. [120] Waters continued to quarrel with Gilmour. [121] In 2021, Waters wrote publicly of their disputes over Pink Floyd reissues and credits, accusing Gilmour of distorting the truth, and complained that Gilmour would not allow him to use Pink Floyd\\'s website and social media channels. [119] Rolling Stone noted that Waters and Gilmour had \"hit yet another low point in their relationship\". [119] Early in 2023, Waters gave an interview in which he criticised Pink Floyd\\'s 2022 track \" Hey, Hey, Rise Up! \", which was released in support of Ukraine. [122] Shortly afterwards, Polly Samson , the wife of Gilmour and a lyricist for Pink Floyd, wrote on Twitter that Waters was antisemitic and \"a lying, thieving, hypocritical, tax-avoiding, lip-synching, misogynistic, sick-with-envy megalomaniac\". Gilmour responded to the tweet on Twitter: \"Every word demonstrably true.\" [123] Waters released a statement on Twitter saying he was aware of the \"incendiary and wildly inaccurate\" comments from Samson and was \"taking advice as to his position\". [123] For the 50th anniversary of The Dark Side of the Moon , Waters recorded a new version, The Dark Side of the Moon Redux , released on 6 October 2023. [124] It features spoken-word sections and no guitar solos, to \"bring out the heart and soul of the album musically and spiritually\". [125] [126] In a press release, Waters wrote: \"Dave, Rick, Nick, and I were so young when we made [the original], and when you look at the world around us, clearly the message hasn\\'t stuck. That\\'s why I started to consider what the wisdom of an 80 year old could bring to a reimagined version.\" [127] In October, Waters held two concerts at the London Palladium , where he performed The Dark Side of the Moon Redux , spoke on topics such as Julian Assange and read from his unpublished memoir. [128] Politics Israeli–Palestinian conflict and accusations of antisemitism Waters is a vocal supporter of Palestine in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict . [129] He is a supporter of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), a campaign for an international boycott of Israel . [130] Waters first saw the Israeli West Bank barrier in 2006, at the request of Palestinian supporters, when he was scheduled to perform in Tel Aviv . He subsequently moved a Tel Aviv concert to Neve Shalom and called for the barrier\\'s removal: \"The wall is an appalling edifice to behold. It is policed by young Israeli soldiers who treated me, a casual observer from another world, with disdainful aggression.\" [131] [132] He has repeatedly described Israel\\'s treatment of Palestinians as apartheid . [133] In 2023, he was one of the principal signers of an open letter called Artists Against Apartheid. [134] [135] Waters has criticised numerous other artists who have performed in Israel. In 2015, Waters published an open letter in Salon criticising the rock band Bon Jovi for performing in Tel Aviv. [136] In 2017, he urged Radiohead to cancel a concert there, signing a letter with 50 others, [130] and was co-signatory on an open letter asking Nick Cave to cancel his. [137] [138] Neither Radiohead nor Cave cancelled their concerts. [139] [140] [141] Waters narrated the 2016 documentary The Occupation of the American Mind: Israel\\'s Public Relations War in the United States about the methods used by Israel to shape American public opinion. [142] [143] In 2013, Rabbi Abraham Cooper , the associate dean of the Jewish human rights organisation the Simon Wiesenthal Center , accused Waters of antisemitism for including a giant pig balloon bearing a Star of David in his concerts. [144] [145] Waters responded that it was one of several religious and political symbols in the show and not an attempt to single out Judaism as an evil force. [129] The same year, Waters compared the Israeli treatment of Palestinians to Nazi Germany , saying: \"The parallels with what went on in the 1930s in Germany are so crushingly obvious.\" [129] He said the reason why few celebrities had joined the BDS movement in the United States was because \"the Jewish lobby is extraordinary powerful here and particularly in the industry that I work in, the music industry\". [146] [147] Following the remarks, the Anti-Defamation League charged that Waters\\' remarks were antisemitic. [147] The American rabbi Shmuley Boteach responded to Waters in the New York Observer : \"That you would have the audacity to compare Jews to monsters who murdered them shows you have no decency, you have no heart, you have no soul.\" [129] Speaking in New York afterwards, Waters said supporters of Israel often attack critics as antisemitic as a \"diversionary tactic\" by conflating anti-Zionism with antisemitism. [129] In a 2017 interview with Omar Barghouti , Waters again likened Israel\\'s public diplomacy to Nazi Germany: \"The thing about propaganda – again, it\\'s not hard to go back to Goebbels or the 1930s. You understand the tactic is to tell the big lie as often as possible over and over and over and over again. And people believe it.\" [148] [149] In 2017, the writer Ian Halperin produced a documentary, Wish You Weren\\'t Here , accusing Waters of antisemitism and \"erecting the very walls that hinder peace in the region and fuel hatred\". [150] In 2020, Major League Baseball stopped advertising Waters\\' This Is Not a Drill concerts after receiving criticism from Jewish advocacy groups. [151] Later that year, Waters said the American Jewish businessman and Republican Party donor Sheldon Adelson was a \"puppet master\" controlling American politics. He said that Adelson believed that \"only Jewish people are completely human ... I\\'m not saying Jewish people believe this. I am saying that he does, and he is pulling the strings.\" [152] In the same interview, Waters said that the murder of George Floyd was carried out with a technique developed by the Israeli Defence Forces . He said the Americans had studied the technique to learn \"how to murder the blacks because they have seen how efficient the Israelis have been at murdering Palestinians in the occupied territories by using those techniques ... The Israelis are proud of it.\" [152] Fascist imagery and German police investigation On 25 February 2023, the German city of Frankfurt cancelled one of Waters\\' scheduled shows, calling him one of the \"most widely known antisemites\" and citing his support for BDS, the imagery at his shows and his talks with the militant group Hamas . The move was supported by the Central Council of Jews in Germany and the Frankfurt Jewish Community. [153] [133] Waters hired a German law firm to challenge the concert cancellation, and released a statement denying the accusations and stating that the cancellation could have \"serious, far-reaching consequences for artists and activists all over the world\". [133] A German court overturned the cancellation, saying the concert should be viewed as a work of art and that it “did not glorify or relativise the crimes of the Nazis or identify with Nazi racist ideology\". [154] That May, German police opened a criminal investigation into Waters and the Nazi-style uniform he wore during his Berlin performance for possible incitement . [155] Nazi symbolism is banned in Germany, with exemptions for educational and artistic purposes. [156] Waters has long used similar uniforms for performances of The Wall, in which the protagonist hallucinates himself as a fascist dictator. [156] Israel\\'s Foreign Ministry criticised Waters for his performance. [157] The US Department of State called it \"deeply offensive to Jewish people\" and accused Waters of having a record of using antisemitic tropes. [158] In the UK, the secretary of state, Michael Gove , and the Labour leader, Keir Starmer , issued statements condemning him. [159] Waters said the use of fascist imagery was a statement in \"opposition to fascism, injustice and bigotry\". [160] He pointed out that he had been using Nazi-inspired uniforms in performances since 1980, but they had only recently attracted controversy. [161] Waters felt the criticism was disingenuous and politically motivated, [160] and that he had been attacked at the behest of the \"Israeli lobby\" in Germany. [162] In an interview with Double Down News , Waters said the accusations of antisemitism were a \"vicious lie\" and \"deeply insulting\", and that he was a victim of cancel culture . He said that the Israeli government was attempting to discredit him as they saw him as an \"existential threat to their settler-colonialist, racist, apartheid regime\". [161] In May 2023, Labour MP Christian Wakeford criticised Waters\\' shows in the UK parliament. Waters responded to critics at a concert in London the following month, calling Wakeford a “a fucking moron\" and a \"cripple\", which Variety said \"drew a sharp intake of breath from some\" in attendance. Waters said he was \"pissed off with this Israeli lobby bullshit\" and said his critics were \"making up stuff because [they have] been told to by [their] masters from the Foreign Office in Tel Aviv \". [163] 2023 documentary alleging antisemitism In September 2023, a documentary alleging antisemitism by Waters, The Dark Side of Roger Waters , was released by the British group Campaign Against Antisemitism . [164] It includes accounts from Waters\\' past collaborators, including the Wall producer Bob Ezrin , who say Waters made offensive remarks about Jewish people. [164] In a separate statement, Ezrin said he did not object to Waters\\' challenging Israeli policy, but that \"if your language directly or by implication promotes the eradication of the world\\'s only Jewish state, then that is absolutely antisemitism in my book\". [164] Waters responded in a statement that he was \"frequently mouthy and prone to irreverence\" but not antisemitic, and that the film misrepresented his views. [164] According to the documentary, in a 2010 email to his crew, Waters described his idea for the inflatable pig to be floated above his gigs, which would have the words \"dirty kyke \", \"follow the money\" and \"Scum\" written on it. [165] In response, Waters said that the \"offensive words I referenced... were my brainstorming ideas on how to make the evils and horrors of fascism and extremism apparent\", and \"not the manifestation of any underlying bigotry as the film suggests\". [165] Hotel cancellations Waters said in an interview with Glenn Greenwald that the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel may have been a false flag operation and that \"resistance to the Israeli occupation\" is legally and morally justifiable. [166] In November 2023, after the interview with Greenwald, the Faena Hotel and the Alvear Palace Hotel in Buenos Aires cancelled Waters reservations without giving a reason. [167] Several Argentine deputies repudiated Waters\\' visit to their country. [168] [169] The Hyatt Centric and the Regency Hotels in Montevideo denied Waters accommodation based on the right of admission. [170] Felipe Schipani , a Colorado Party National Representative , asked the Municipality of Montevideo to withdraw the \"illustrious visitor to Montevideo\" title given to Waters in 2018. [171] BMG cancellation In January 2024, the BMG music company cancelled a publishing agreement with Waters over his comments on Israel, Ukraine and the United States. [172] Russian invasion of Ukraine A week before the Russian invasion of Ukraine , Waters told an RT interviewer that rumours of Russia launching an invasion were \"bullshit\" and anti-Russian propaganda. [173] After the invasion, Waters said that US President Joe Biden was \"fuelling the fire in the Ukraine... that is a huge crime\", and questioned why the United States was not encouraging Ukraine \"to negotiate, obviating the need for this horrific, horrendous war\". Responding to accusations that he was placing the responsibility to negotiate on the country that was invaded, Waters said that Russia was responding to provocations from NATO : \"This war is basically about the action and reaction of NATO pushing right up to the Russian border – which they promised they wouldn\\'t do when Gorbachev negotiated the withdrawal of the U.S.S.R. from the whole of Eastern Europe.\" [174] [175] In another interview, Waters said the invasion of Ukraine was \"probably the most provoked invasion ever\" and that he refused to \"see Russia from the current Russo-phobic perspective\". [176] On 5 September 2022, the day after Olena Zelenska , the First Lady of Ukraine , appeared on the BBC, Waters published an open letter to her. He accused Ukrainian \"extreme nationalists\" of starting the war and made no mention of Russia\\'s responsibility for the invasion. [177] He argued that the West should not provide Ukraine with weapons, and that Western governments were prolonging the war with their support. Waters urged her husband to end the war based on the Minsk agreements . [178] Waters\\'s concerts in Poland were cancelled following local outrage over his comments. [177] In February 2023, at the Russian government\\'s request, Waters gave a speech to the United Nations Security Council . He condemned the invasion of Ukraine as illegal, but said it was \"not unprovoked\" and that he also \"condemned the provocateurs in the strongest possible terms. ... The only sensible course of action today is to call for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine\". [176] [179] The speech drew criticism from American, Ukrainian and Albanian diplomats, and praise from Russia\\'s deputy UN ambassador, Dmitry Polyanskiy. [176] Other views Waters performing \"Comfortably Numb\" during The Wall Live in Kansas City, 30 October 2010 After the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and subsequent tsunami disaster, Waters performed \"Wish You Were Here\" with Eric Clapton during a benefit concert on the American network NBC . [180] He criticised the Hunting Act of 2004 and supported the Countryside Alliance , but explained he was defending the right to hunt rather than supporting the activity himself. Waters explained that whether he supported hunting or not, it was important to defend it as a right. [83] [181] In 2007, Waters became a spokesman for Millennium Promise , a non-profit organisation fighting poverty and malaria . [182] That July, he participated in the American leg of the Live Earth concert, aimed at raising awareness about global climate change. [183] In 2015, Waters said that socialism was \"a good thing\", and called for socialised healthcare in the United States. [184] Waters is supportive of veterans , which he partly attributes to the death of his father in World War II. He allocates a block of tickets for veterans at his shows. For a few years he performed with a group of wounded veterans that was arranged through the United States National Military Medical Center. [185] In 2012, he led a benefit for United States military veterans, Stand Up for Heroes, and invited a group of combat-wounded veterans, MusiCorps , to perform with him. [186] Waters performing in Gdańsk in August 2018 during the Us + Them Tour , criticising the Polish government \\'s treatment of the courts and media. Waters opposed Brexit (the UK leaving the European Union ). Following the June 2016 referendum , which resulted in leaving the EU, he said: \"I thought we were better than that. I was wrong.\" [187] He criticised US President Donald Trump and his policies. [188] In 2017, Waters condemned Trump\\'s plan to build a wall separating the US and Mexico , drawing parallels to The Wall . [189] After the April 2018 Douma chemical attack carried out by the Syrian government, Waters called civil defence volunteers, the White Helmets , \"a fake organisation that exists only to create propaganda for the jihadists and terrorists\" trying to incite the West to \"start dropping bombs on people in Syria\". [190] [191] [192] [193] In 2018, Waters included the Brazilian far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro in a list of \"neo-fascists\" displayed on a big screen at his concert in São Paulo which drew mixed responses from the crowd. [194] In a concert in Rio de Janeiro that October, he acknowledged the murdered Brazilian councilwoman Marielle Franco and brought her daughter, sister and widow on stage. [195] In an interview with the online music magazine BrooklynVegan , he said he tried to visit the progressive politician Lula da Silva while he was in prison on corruption charges, which he called false saying that \"the only reason Lula is in prison is because he would have won the election\". [196] In 2019, Waters spoke at a rally outside London\\'s Home Office calling for the release of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , and dedicated a performance of \"Wish You Were Here\" to him. [197] The following year, he spoke at a rally in support of Assange outside parliament in London. [198] He showed his support for the 2019–2022 Chilean protests through a video from POUSTA.com. [199] In an interview with communist deputy Camila Vallejo , he condemned the then president Sebastian Piñera , calling him a \"rat\" and he also indicated that the 2022 Chilean national plebiscite is \"extraordinarily revolutionary\". [200] Waters supports Steven Donziger , an American lawyer embroiled in environmental litigation against Chevron corporation , and has funded some of Donziger\\'s legal fees. [201] He endorsed the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn , in the 2019 UK general election , describing him as a \"beacon of hope\". [202] During his 2022 This Is Not a Drill shows, every US president from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump was labelled a war criminal and a message was displayed that Joe Biden was \"just getting started\". [203] In an interview with Michael Smerconish , who stated that \"The Chinese are too busy encircling Taiwan as we speak,\" Waters responded that China was not encircling Taiwan and that \"Taiwan is part of China. And that\\'s been absolutely accepted by the whole of the international community since 1948\". [174] Artistry Waters in Barcelona during The Wall Live, 5 April 2011 Waters\\'s primary instrument in Pink Floyd was the bass guitar. However, he said in 1992 that he was \"never a bass player\" and was \"not interested in playing instruments and I never have been\". [204] Gilmour said that Waters used a \"limited\" and \"very simple\" bass style and had not been interested in improving, and that Gilmour had played many of the bass parts on Pink Floyd records. [204] According to Mason in 2018, Waters feels that \"everything should be judged on the writing rather than the playing\". [121] Waters briefly played a Höfner bass, but replaced it with a Rickenbacker RM-1999/4001S . In 1970, it was stolen along with the rest of Pink Floyd\\'s equipment in New Orleans. [23] He began using Fender Precision Basses in 1968, originally alongside the Rickenbacker 4001, and then exclusively after the Rickenbacker was lost in 1970. First seen at a concert in Hyde Park, London, in July 1970, the black P-Bass was rarely used until April 1972, when it became his main stage guitar. On 2 October 2010, it became the basis for a Fender Artist Signature model. [205] Waters endorses Rotosound Jazz Bass 77 flat-wound strings. [206] He has used Selmer , WEM , Hiwatt , and Ashdown amplifiers but used Ampeg for later tours. He has employed delay , tremolo , chorus , stereo panning and phaser effects in his bass playing. [207] Waters experimented with the EMS Synthi A and VCS 3 synthesisers on Pink Floyd pieces such as \" On the Run \", [208] \" Welcome to the Machine \", [209] and \" In the Flesh? \" [210] He played electric and acoustic guitar on Pink Floyd tracks using Fender, Martin, Ovation and Washburn guitars. [207] He played electric guitar on the Pink Floyd song \" Sheep \", from Animals , [211] and acoustic guitar on several Pink Floyd recordings, such as \"Pigs on the Wing 1\\xa0&\\xa02\" , also from Animals , [212] \" Southampton Dock \" from The Final Cut , [213] and on \" Mother \" from The Wall . [214] A Binson Echorec 2 delay effect was used on his bass lead track \" One of These Days \". [215] Waters plays trumpet during concert performances of \" Outside the Wall \". [216] Personal life In 1969, Waters married his childhood sweetheart Judith Trim , a school teacher and potter. She was featured on the gatefold sleeve of the original release of the Pink Floyd album Ummagumma , but excised from CD reissues. [217] They had no children and divorced in 1975. [218] Trim died in 2001. [219] In 1976, Waters married Carolyne Christie , the niece of the third Marquess of Zetland . [218] They had a son, Harry Waters , a musician who has played keyboards with his father\\'s touring band since 2002, and a daughter, India Waters, who has worked as a model. [220] Christie and Waters divorced in 1992. [218] In 1993, Waters married Priscilla Phillips. They had a son, Jack Fletcher. Their marriage ended in 2001. [221] In 2004, Waters became engaged to the actress and filmmaker Laurie Durning. [222] They married on 14 January 2012 [223] and filed for divorce in September 2015. [224] Waters married his fifth wife, Kamilah Chavis, in October 2021. [225] Waters has homes in Long Island and Hampshire . [226] He is an atheist .

It was performed in 1994 to support their album The Division Bell , which was released two days before the tour\\'s start date. Following the tour\\'s conclusion, the group quietly disbanded. In 1995 the band released the live album Pulse to commemorate the tour. History [ edit ] The Division Bell Tour in 1994 was promoted by Canadian concert impresario Michael Cohl and became the highest-grossing tour in rock music history to that date, with the band playing the entirety of The Dark Side of the Moon in some shows. The first show they played the whole The Dark Side of the Moon was on 15 July 1994 at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan , which was the first time since 1975 it was played. While preparing for the tour, Pink Floyd spent most of March rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in California and a soundstage at Universal Studios Florida . [1] The concerts featured even more special effects than the previous tour, including two custom designed airships. [2] Three stages leapfrogged around North America and Europe, each 180 feet (55\\xa0m) long and featuring a 130-foot (40\\xa0m) arch resembling the Hollywood Bowl venue. All in all, the tour required 700 tons of steel carried by 53 articulated trucks, a crew of 161 people and an initial investment of US$4 million plus US$25 million of running costs just to stage. This tour played to 5.5 million people in 68 cities; each concert gathered an average audience of 45,000. The shows are documented by the Pulse album, video and DVD . The final concert of the tour on 29 October 1994 turned out to be the final full-length Pink Floyd performance, and the last time Pink Floyd played live before their one-off 18-minute reunion with Roger Waters at Live 8 on 2 July 2005, which the reunion marked their first concert in 24 years since The Wall Tour (1980–1981) as a quartet, as well as their final concert before Richard Wright\\'s death in 2008. Sponsorship [ edit ] A Volkswagen Golf Pink Floyd Edition The tour was sponsored in Europe by Volkswagen , which also issued a commemorative version of its top-selling car, the \" Golf Pink Floyd\", one of which was given as a prize at each concert. It was a standard Golf with Pink Floyd decals and a premium stereo, and had Volkswagen\\'s most environmentally friendly engine, at Gilmour\\'s insistence. [3] In 1995, Gilmour said he was uncomfortable with the sponsorship: \"I don\\'t want [Volkswagen] to be able to say they have a connection with Pink Floyd, that they\\'re part of our success. We will not do it again.\" He said he had donated the money he made from the sponsorship to charity. [4] Sales [ edit ] At the end of the year, the Division Bell Tour was announced as the biggest tour ever, with worldwide gross of over £150 million (about US$250 million). In the U.S. alone, it grossed US$103.5 million from 59 concerts. However, this record was short-lived; less than a year later, the Rolling Stones \\' Voodoo Lounge Tour finished with a worldwide gross of over US$300 million. The Rolling Stones, AC/DC , Metallica , U2 , the Police , Bon Jovi , Roger Waters and Madonna remain the only acts ever to achieve a higher worldwide gross from a tour, even when adjusting for inflation. The stage set for the tour was designed by Stufish Entertainment Architecture, lead by architect Mark Fisher.

Published Jul 17, 2020 By Clarence Jan Pink Floyd live in 1967 - HDPinkFloyd / Youtube Pink Floyd is undeniably one of the biggest bands to ever come out of London, dabbling in a variety of rock subgenres, from psychedelia to arena rock. As most people know, the band’s history is quite tragic due to Syd Barrett’s sudden departure from the band due to mental health and substance abuse issues. He was replaced by David Gilmour, who helped Roger Waters with most of the songwriting duties. But who was really Pink in the Floyd? Syd Barrett was one of the band’s founding members and the primary reason why Pink Floyd was the way it is. Barrett had a natural gift in songwriting, as he was able to conjure up complex, vivid imagery with just a few lines of lyrics. This was paired with his love for experimentation and thus became the way of how psychedelia became the band’s main driver in his era. But Barrett, slowly growing detached due to his substance abuse and mental issues, was soon booted from the band due to his dysfunctional behaviors. David Gilmour was brought in as Barrett’s replacement, the two musicians already knowing each other from before. Whilst Gilmour didn’t exactly write the bulk of Pink Floyd’s material after Barrett’s departure, his contributions to the sonic texture of their music are incomparable. Ranging from soaring, ethereal soundscapes to gritty, indulgent arrangements, Gilmour did it all to heighten the listener’s experience with the band. He also sings main vocals for the most part of Pink Floyd’s career. After Barrett left, Waters was tasked with most of Pink Floyd’s written material. The bassist made use of his wide range of knowledge to speak to audiences of multiple ethnicities and backgrounds, shattering barriers that were once thought impenetrable. After emulating some of Barrett’s thematic styles, Waters eventually branched out into a more brazen execution of his own thoughts with socially-charged commentary and addressing recurring issues at a grand scale. All that aside, one can’t really point out one “true” frontman for Pink Floyd. Each of the three members was essential in creating the band’s illustrious run, with the style eventually integrating and evolving into a higher form that had the DNA of Barret, Gilmour, and Waters in it.

The singer, 60, who suffered from an LSD-induced breakdown while at the peak of his career in the Sixties, died last Friday (July 7). It has been reported that he died from complications related to diabetes, however, other reports suggest the cause of death was cancer. A statement from Pink Floyd said: “The band are naturally very upset and sad to learn of Syd Barrett ‘s death. Advertisement “ Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire.” His brother Alan confirmed his death earlier today (July 11), saying: “He died peacefully at home. There will be a private family funeral in the next few days.” ‘ Syd ’ Barrett was born Roger Keith Barrett in Cambridge on January 6, 1946, the youngest of five children. A keen musician from an early age, he acquired the nickname which became his most prominent moniker aged 15, a reference to another Cambridge -based musician, also named Sid Barrett . Barrett formed Pink Floyd along with Roger Waters , Nick Mason and Rick Wright in 1965, reputedly naming the band after two blues artists, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council , who had a place in his record collection. From R&B beginnings, the band developed a unique psychedelic style which sat well with the swinging London hipsters of the time. They quickly became the house band at the acclaimed UFO Club on Tottenham Court Road in the West End , which championed acts from the psychedelic underground. The band recorded their first single ‘Arnold Layne’ , written by Barrett about a cross-dresser, in January 1967. Produced by 60s scenester Joe Boyd , the recording proved enough for EMI to offer the group a contract. Advertisement After scoring a Top Ten hit with ‘See Emily Play’ , again written by Barrett , the band released their debut LP ‘The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn’ in August 1967. The record, on which Barrett wrote eight songs and co-wrote another two, was recorded at Abbey Road studios in London ’s St John’s Wood , next door to where The Beatles were making ‘Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band’ . As well as composing many of the tunes, Barrett was renowned for his innovative guitar playing, experimenting with feedback and distortion and using props such as a Zippo Lighter to get a unique sound from his Fender Esquire . The UK public liked what they heard – the LP made the Top Ten and the band started to attract a devoted following. However, Barrett was becoming increasingly unhinged, which coincided with regular consumption of LSD. The star started to behave erratically at gigs, most memorably at a show in San Francisco when he put hair gel on his head until it slowly melted over his face thanks to the heat from the stage lights. Towards the end of 1967, friend of the band David Gilmour was asked to join as second guitarist to compensate for Barrett ’s behaviour. It got so bad that on the way to a gig in Southampton in January 1968, Pink Floyd elected not to pick him up. When Pink Floyd ’s second album ‘A Saucerful Of Secrets’ was released in 1968, it contained only one Barrett composition, ‘Jugband Blues’ . His official departure was announced in March 1968. Following this, Barrett holed himself up in his flat in London ’s Earls Court , resurfacing in 1970 to release two solo albums, ‘The Madcap Laughs’ and ‘Barrett’ , which were not commercially successful. Among the people helping him out on these records were Gilmour and Waters . Gilmour also backed Barrett at his one concert during this period, in June 1970 at London Olympia . In 1972 Barrett resurfaced in a band called Stars , but he quit after one gig at Cambridge Corn Exchange . In  1974, his old manager Peter Jenner managed to get Barrett to return to Abbey Road in hope of recording another album. When this also proved fruitless, Barrett sold the rights to his solo albums back to the record label and returned to Cambridge to live with his mother. He never returned to the music industry, and lived in the same house until his death. He was said to be fond of painting, writing and gardening. Pink Floyd ensured he still got regular royalty payments. Pink Floyd of course, went on to achieve massive worldwide fame, and ‘Shine On You Crazy Diamond’ , from the 1975 album ‘Wish You Were Here’ , was a tribute to him. Sensationally, Barrett made a brief visit to the studio when the track was being recorded, having put on weight and shaved his hair. The rest of the band have since confessed their distress at seeing him in such a dishevelled state. So what are your memories of Syd ? How do you feel about his death?

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What genre is Pink Floyd? Pink Floyd\\'s music broadly falls under the rock genre. Specifically, the band was instrumental in the development of the psychedelic rock movement and the progressive rock genre. Who are the members of Pink Floyd? Pink Floyd\\'s founding members were Syd Barett on lead vocals and guitar Roger Waters on bass guitar and vocals Nick Mason on drums Richard Wright on keyboard and vocals David Gilmour later joined the band as vocalist and guitarist. When Barrett subsequently left the group, Waters took over responsibility as the main songwriter. While Wright and Waters left the group, leaving Mason and Gilmour to continue the band as a duo, Wright did eventually rejoin Pink Floyd and Waters joined the band in 2005 for a one-off performance. Gilmour and Mason most recently revived the band in 2022. How did Pink Floyd get their name and what does it mean? Before Pink Floyd, the band had several other members and names, including Sigma 6, the Meggadeaths, Leonard\\'s Lodgers, the Abdabs, the Screaming Abdabs, the Spectrum Five and the Tea Set. In 1965, the band started using the name the Pink Floyd Sound. This was later changed to The Pink Floyd and later amended again to just Pink Floyd. The name change came about suddenly, when the band realized another group with the same name of Tea Set were due to play at the same performance. Created by Barrett, the band\\'s name was inspired by two blues musicians: Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. Where is Pink Floyd from? Pink Floyd comes from the UK. The band was formed in the English capital of London. When did David Gilmour join Pink Floyd and who did he replace? Gilmour joined Pink Floyd in December 1967, replacing formative member Syd Barrett. When and why did Roger Waters leave Pink Floyd? Waters left Pink Floyd in 1985 because of personal tensions and differences between the band members. When and why did Pink Floyd break up? While many people see Waters\\' 1985 decision to leave the band as the time when Pink Floyd broke up, two members (Mason and Gilmour) fought to continue performing under the same name. Waters sued the band to prevent the use of the name \"Pink Floyd\", but he lost the case. Gilmour and Mason subsequently recorded a further two albums as Pink Floyd before becoming inactive for a long period. Gilmour, Mason, Waters and Wright reunited for a one-time concert in 2005. Following Barrett\\'s and Wright\\'s deaths in 2006 and 2008, respectively, the band released its last studio album in 2014, using previously unused material. In 2022, Mason and Gilmour reformed to release a song protesting the war in Ukraine with Andriy Khlyvnyuk from the Ukrainian band Boombox titled “Hey Hey Rise Up” with all proceeds going to support humanitarian aid to Ukrainians affected by Russian aggression and genocide. Despite turmoil and inactive periods, it\\'s arguable that Pink Floyd has never officially broken up. When did Pink Floyd\\'s The Wall come out?

The film Pink Floyd – The Wall , which was based on the album, was released in 1982. Where can I watch the movie Pink Floyd – The Wall ?

When did The Dark Side of the Moon come out and what is the album about? The Dark Side of the Moon came out in March 1973. Despite the name, the album isn\\'t actually about the skies, space, astrology or astronomy; rather, the title references mental struggles that can lead to insanity. The band has offered several snippets of explanations about the thematic album, though it\\'s mostly down to listener interpretation. Originally planned to show the pressures and struggles faced by musicians, the album evolved to include diverse topics, including the passing of time, death, mental challenges, war, and wealth.

The band recorded several albums, achieving worldwide success with The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), and The Wall (1979).
