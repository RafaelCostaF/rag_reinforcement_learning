From Compton to All England Club It doesn’t seem all that long ago that were were hearing about two sisters out of Compton, California who were going to reshape the landscape of women’s tennis. With their beaded hair and massive serves, they came leaping on to the WTP scene and didn’t let go for almost three decades. Serena made her professional debut in 1995 at the Bell Challenge in Quebec, before sitting back and letting her game and her body develop for the professional ranks. In 1997, she returned to the professional circuit and had some stunning wins over some of the top players in the world as a 16 years old. She would win her first tournament two years later at the Evert Cup, and then later that year captured her first Grand Slam which came at Flushing Meadows at the US Open . She took down Martina Hingis in the final and announced her presence on one of tennis’ biggest stages. Wimbledon breakthrough in 2002 She would have to wait for almost three years before she would reach the pinnacle of the tennis world again. When she returned, there was absolutely no stopping her.

Now the postseason begins, but the path to the Super Bowl can be confusing if you’re following along for the first time. Though a couple of top contenders from last season are noticeably absent (where’d the Rams go?), many familiar faces and franchises are back to battle for the Lombardi Trophy. But how many teams qualify for the postseason? How did they get here? How did the league determine the seeds and where the games will be played? Advertisement If you’re looking for answers to all of the above or if you just need a refresher before the final few weeks of the NFL season, we’ve got you covered. How many teams make the playoffs? Fourteen of the league’s 32 teams qualify for the postseason: seven from the American Football Conference and seven from the National Football Conference. Before the 2020 regular season, 12 teams made the postseason. Team owners voted to expand the playoffs to 14 in March 2020. GO DEEPER NFL Power Rankings: Bengals, Chiefs among teams riding hot streaks entering playoffs How do teams qualify for the playoffs? The first four playoff spots in each conference are awarded to the teams that finish with the best record in each division (North, South, East and West). The remaining six spots (three from the AFC and three from the NFC) are given to the teams with the best record who did not win their division. How are teams seeded at the beginning of the postseason? The division champions are seeded in order of win percentages.\", '24, 2023 | 2:00 PM EDT Only six NFL teams that have started 0-3 made the playoffs in the Super Bowl era (since 1966). Usually, most teams that lose the first three games are bad and not legitimate candidates to reach the postseason. However, there are a few rare examples of teams finding their way to the playoffs after such a start. One of the six teams was the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the strike-shortened 1982 season. Tampa Bay finished 5-4 after a 0-3 start, but the playoffs were expanded from 10 to 16 teams because of the strike. Thus, we will not include the Buccaneers in our look at 0–3 teams to make the playoffs. Which NFL Teams Have Made Playoffs After a 0–3 Start? 1981 New York Jets: Finished 10-5-1, qualified as AFC Wild Card team 1992 San Diego Chargers: Finished 11-5, won AFC West 1995 Detroit Lions: Finished 10-6, qualified as NFC Wild Card team 1998 Buffalo Bills: Finished 10-6, qualified as AFC Wild Card team 2018 Houston Texans: Finished 11-5, won AFC South What Is the Common Thread Between the 5 Teams? All five of the teams won at least five games in a row after starting 0-3. The 2018 Texans won nine straight games after losing the first three. The 1992 Chargers and the 1995 Lions each had seven-game win streaks during their respective seasons. Four of the five teams did not lose consecutive games the rest of the season. The 1992 Chargers lost only one of the last 12 games. The 1995 Lions were the only team to lose consecutive games after a 0-3 start.

      "[INFO] Query: how many stanley cups have the boston bruins won?...\n",
      "[INFO] Chunks: ['via Getty Images By Stephen Smith June 10, 2019 The Boston Bruins claimed their first Stanley Cup in Montreal on a Saturday night in March 1929, sweeping aside the mighty Canadiens. Back home, a crowd of 3,000 met the team’s train at North Station. Then again, the series with Montreal was only a semi-final. Any doubts to their hold on the trophy were put to rest six days later, when the Bruins definitively won the Cup, conquering the Rangers in New York. Two Stanley Cups in a week? It’s complicated. And it’s not something that is reflected in the records, either: Those distinctly show that the Bruins have won six championships (so far), not seven. And yet 90 years before the Bruins were attempting to win this year’s Cup finals and extend a run of Boston-area pro sports dominance , a brief confusion in the hockey continuum seemed to present the Bruins, at least by some accounts, with the opportunity for a one-of-a-kind Stanley Cup double. The 1928-29 season was a banner year for the 12-year-old N.H.L. From just four teams in the 1923-24 season, the league had spread to 10 cities, six in the United States. Overall attendance was up by 22 percent from the previous season, with the Bruins rated the biggest draw. They were the first American team to join the N.H.L., bankrolled by the grocery magnate Charles Adams. His first hire in 1924 was Art Ross, a 38-year-old Montrealer with a reputation as a genius of hockey strategy and innovation who had also won two Stanley Cups earlier as a player. First awarded in 1893 by Lord Stanley, Canada’s governor-general, hockey’s most coveted prize was, originally, a challenge cup intended to reward the best Canadian team, regardless of league. From 1918 on, however, the Stanley Cup', 'by Jamie Being the first American team to join the NHL in 1924, the Boston Bruins have had nearly 100 years to establish their success as a franchise. The Bruins have hosted the likes of hockey legends such as defenseman Bobby Orr, goalie Tuukka Rask and forward Patrice Bergeron. The hockey culture in Boston is long-standing, and New Englanders are passionate about their Bruins. With such a long history, how many Stanley Cups have the Boston Bruins won? The Boston Bruins have won 6 Stanley Cups in their nearly millennium-long history. Their first Cup came in 1929, with two more added in 1939 and 1941. They won two more in 1970 and 1972, winning their most recent in 2011. Stanley Cup Finals 1929: Boston Bruins vs New York Rangers Not having to wait long to find success in the NHL, the Bruins were able to capture their first Stanley Cup just 5 years after their inception into the league. Because the early Cup Finals had different rules, the Bruins were able to defeat the Rangers in just 2 games. Goalkeeper Tiny Thompson managed a shutout in the first game and allowed just one goal in the second. Boston was led by winger Harry Oliver, who had 1 goal and 1 assist in the series. Centers Dutch Gainor and Bill Carson both added a goal, with Boston’s final of 4 total goals coming from defenseman/winger Dit Clapper. See the Official NHL Shop of the Boston Bruins here for any fan gear you want! Stanley Cup Finals 1939: Boston Bruins vs Toronto Maple Leafs After winning their first Cup quite quickly, Boston fans had to wait another 10 years to celebrate their team winning another one. This time, the Bruins faced the Maple Leafs in a best-of-7 series. Boston center Bill Cowley', \"Bruins had another chance to win Lord Stanley’s Cup. Number Six is Sweet During the 2010-11 season, the Bruins finally won their sixth and most recent championship. Fittingly, they knocked off the Canadiens in the first round of the playoffs, surviving a tight, seven-game series. After sweeping the Flyers in the next round, Boston had to endure a seven-game series with the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Conference Finals. That was followed by a seven-game series in the Stanley Cup Finals with the Vancouver Canucks. After losing Game 2 in overtime, the Bruins were behind 2-0 in the series. But the Bruins won the next two games, 8-1 and 4-0, to even the series. Ultimately, the series was tied 3-3, with the home team winning every game. However, the Bruins broke that streak with a convincing 4-0 Game 7 win in Vancouver, bringing the Stanley Cup back to Boston after a nearly 40-year wait. Unfortunately, the Bruins came up short two years later, losing to the Blackhawks in the Stanley Cup Finals. However, the quest continues for Boston’s seventh Stanley Cup victory. Questions?

The hosts are placed seventh going into the game, having amassed 36 points while the visitors are 14th with 25 points. Marseille are chasing for another season in the Champions League after missing out this season. Recently appointed Jean-Louis Gasset has engineered a good run at the team after taking over from Genarro Gattuso.

Man Utd 0 Newcastle 3 (Willock 60) Joe Willock puts Newcastle into the quarter-finals with another fine goal! It was totally against the run of play but Newcastle won’t care one bit. Joelinton made a fine tackle on Amrabat in the centre circle, with Willock collecting the loose ball. He charged straight at the heart of the defence, all the way to edge of the United area. Gordon blocked off Maguire and that allowed Willock to hammer a low shot into the bottom corner. Onana had no chance.

Willock’s 65th-minute header, his third goal of the season, and a second from substitute Wilson two minutes from time inflicted just a second defeat in 17 games in all competitions on Erik ten Hag ’s side and gained a measure of revenge for February’s Carabao Cup final heartache at Wembley. It was a deserved 2-0 victory too for the Magpies, who created the better chances in the game and might have gone ahead through Alexander Isak, Sean Longstaff and Willock before they broke the deadlock in front of a crowd of 52,268.

The context: Even viewed as a percentage, it could be argued that the comparison between Ascari\\'s eight-race season (one of which was the Indy 500 that he didn\\'t compete in, raising his true percentage to 87.5%) and Verstappen\\'s 22-race season is pretty tenuous. A more modern example -- that just so happens to be third on the list of highest win percentages in a season -- is Michael Schumacher\\'s 72.22% from 2004, which saw him win 13 of the 18 races that year. Verstappen was crowned 2023 champion in Qatar. Photo by Michael Potts/BSR Agency/Getty Images Points The record: Max Verstappen scored 575 of the 620 points on offer in 2023 -- another new record that eclipses the 454 points he scored last year and the previous record of 413 held by Lewis Hamilton from 2019. The context: Given the changes to the points system over the years and the growing calendar (including the addition of points-scoring sprint races) the number \"575\" doesn\\'t mean a huge amount. However, when you consider Verstappen scored 92.74% of the points on offer, it helps to underline the level of his dominance in a historical context. What\\'s more, Verstappen scored over double the points of teammate Sergio Pérez (284), who finished second in the drivers\\' championship, and 166 more than the Mercedes team as a whole, which finished second to Red Bull in the constructors\\' championship. Added to that, Verstappen\\'s tally at the Belgian Grand Prix in July (before F1\\'s summer break) would have been enough to secure this year\\'s title.

How far up the wins list can he climb this year? Red Bull’s Max Verstappen earned his 10th win in the last 12 Formula 1 races two Sundays at Bahrain International Circuit, winning the Bahrain Grand Prix for the first time in his career to open up a season on top of the podium for the first time in his career, The win was the 36th victory of the 25-year-old Dutchman’s career, which is good for sixth place on the all-time wins list. After the race, Mercedes’ George Russell, who finished in seventh place, stated that he feels Red Bull and the RB19 are going to win all 23 races on the 2023 schedule, given the performance they showed in Bahrain. Ironically, the opening race weekend of the 2023 Formula 1 season was one in which many believed the Red Bull wasn’t even as good as it could have been. Last year in the RB18, Verstappen broke the all-time single season record with 15 victories. The previous record had been shared by Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel, who won 13 races in 2004 and 2013, respectively.

The band recorded several albums, achieving worldwide success with The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), and The Wall (1979). In 1985, Waters declared Pink Floyd \"a spent force,\" but the remaining members, led by Gilmour, continued recording and touring under the name Pink Floyd. Although they were unsuccessfully sued by Waters for rights to the name, they again enjoyed worldwide success with A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987), and The Division Bell (1994). Eventually they reached a settlement out of court with Waters allowing them use of the name.

      "[INFO] Chunks: ['(the melting face), Led Zeppelin’s In Through the Out Door , Wings’ Band on the Run , as well as most of Pink Floyd’s albums, including Meddle and Animals . The Beginning of the End for Pink Floyd Pink Floyd on tour in March 1973. John Lynn Kirk/Redferns/Getty Images Dark Side of the Moon sent Pink Floyd into orbit. The band became something resembling a machine, crafting subsequent albums — notably The Wall — and touring intensively but growing apart in the process. Waters nudged Wright to leave, and it became Waters, the other guys, and session musicians. These days, Waters even downplays the contributions of his fellow bandmates and engineer Alan Parsons, who weaved some mighty sonic magic at the mixing boards. Pink Floyd never again felt this cohesive as a band, nor did any subsequent album hang together as cohesively as Dark Side of the Moon . Some fans might make the case for The Wall , but it grows ponderous and is too long by several songs. Children of The Dark Side Roger Waters in May 1973. David Warner Ellis/Redferns/Getty Images It’s easy to name bands and performers influenced by The Dark Side of the Moon . Look no further than Radiohead , The Flaming Lips, Tame Impala, Tool, and early Coldplay , not to mention the many, many Pink Floyd cover band that have earned their money playing “Money.” But the influence of Dark Side extends far beyond that (or any tribute albums, collectors’ editions, etc.). It’s very likely that you’ve worn, or still wear, a Dark Side T-shirt. Your kid might, too. Hell, people who’ve never listened to a note on the album recognized its cover, or have heard about the supposed connections to The Wizard of Oz . Also, back in 2020, the Dark', 'Studios between May 1972 and January 1973, and having been developed and rehearsed during a series of live performances in the months preceding, “The Dark Side of the Moon” is the ultimate expression of Pink Floyd’s sonic artistry – an Olympian psychedelic concept album that, despite being very much of its time, still retains the ability the dazzle and astound in the digital age. Lyric writer, bassist and principal architect Roger Waters deserves much of the credit for its record-breaking success, as do bandmates David Gilmour (vocals and guitar), Nick Mason (drums) and Richard Wright (keyboards and vocals), who were all similarly at the top of their game. “There was something about the symbiosis of the musical talents of the four of us that worked really well,” Waters told Billboard in 2006, looking back on the record. The ground-breaking work of engineer Alan Parsons meanwhile, can be heard in the myriad of tape loops and then-revolutionary effects that run throughout the album’s hypnotic grooves. Trending on Billboard A landmark record in every respect, including its now iconic prism sleeve (courtesy of Storm Thorgerson), “The Dark Side of the Moon,” which was the band’s eighth studio album, transformed Pink Floyd from ambitious art-house hipsters to international superstars, while influencing virtually every rock band of the past forty years. It also famously inspired an unsubstantiated theory about the album’s deliberate synchronicity with “The Wizard of Oz.” But the album needed no help to imbue listeners with inner visions. Here’s our exploratory, mind-warping journey through the deepest reaches of each song on Floyd’s 1973 studio masterpiece. “Speak To Me” “Speak To Me” and “Breathe (In The Air)” Beginning with the gradual fade-in of a synthesized heartbeat, “The Dark Side Of The Moon’s” 90-second long opening instrumental collage perfectly sets the tone for the', 'the Daily Telegraph has reported the singer secured a cash payment with Pink Floyd and their label, EMI. ^ \"The Dark Side Of The Moon\" vinyl gatefold / booklet v t e Pink Floyd David Gilmour Nick Mason Syd Barrett Bob Klose Roger Waters Richard Wright Studio albums The Piper at the Gates of Dawn A Saucerful of Secrets More Ummagumma Atom Heart Mother Meddle Obscured by Clouds The Dark Side of the Moon Wish You Were Here Animals The Wall The Final Cut A Momentary Lapse of Reason The Division Bell The Endless River Live albums Ummagumma Delicate Sound of Thunder Pulse London \\'66–\\'67 Is There Anybody Out There?

While Macca wasn’t thrilled about taking on the bass role, he understood that he needed to do it. “So it was like oh-oh, we haven’t got a bass player. And everyone sort of turned round and looked at me. I was a bit lumbered with it, really. It was like, well, it better be you then. I don’t think you could have caught John doing it—I don’t think he would have done it. ‘No, you’re kidding.

There’s no denying that Paul McCartney is the most famous bassist in a band ever. Many bassists go unrecognized, but Paul McCartney changed that by being a pivotal member of The Beatles. However, the “Let it Be” singer initially didn’t want to be the bassist and only took on the role when no one else could fill the slot. Stu Sutcliffe was the original bass guitarist for The Beatles Paul McCartney | David Redfern/Redferns Stuart “Stu” Sutcliffe was the original bassist for The Beatles. While his time with the band wasn’t long, he did have a lasting impact as he is credited with coming up with the name “Beetles,” along with John Lennon. In an interview with Reverb , Paul McCartney said Sutcliffe initially wanted to go to art school, and he won a painting competition that awarded him 75 quid. The Beatles convinced him to buy a bass guitar with that money, and he eventually became the bassist since none of the others could afford to play bass nor wanted to. “Stu was suddenly there just because he could afford the bass, and none of us could,” McCartney explained. “None of us wanted to be the bass player.

If at times it might have felt a touch challenging, it was all to the good of the record that was being created. What emerged, on September 15, 2010, was Maroon 5’s catchiest pop collection to date. The strident funk and rock hybrid tone of the previous album – already an evolution from the band’s rockier debut – had been freshly illuminated by a high-energy pop sheen that drew references from Lange’s 80s and 90s heyday, while remaining sharp and contemporary. Maroon 5 - Misery (Official Music Video) Watch this video on YouTube Click to load video The album’s first single was “Misery,” a collaboration between Levine, guitarist Jesse Carmichael and long-time collaborator Sam Farrar, who was now increasingly working with the band. Hitting radio in June 2010, in advance of Hands All Over ’s release, the track received a critical thumbs-up and, alongside a video featuring another one of Maroon 5’s provocative but tongue-in-cheek storylines, started its ascent up the charts. Its subsequent, inexplicable stalling outside the US Top 10 (at No.14) and a peak of No.30 in the UK seemed at odds with the song’s obvious commercial direction. A later nomination at the following year’s Grammys for Best Pop Performance By A Duo Or Group With A Vocal would give the song the credit it deserved, but it set the Hands All Over campaign off on a shakier footing than had been expected. However, reviews for the album were generally stronger than those that had initially greeted It Won’t Be Soon Before Long . It was as if the critics were finally warming up to Maroon 5’s potent songwriting power.

Back then, and for many years afterwards, Crosby was addicted to alcohol, cocaine and heroin. As he has often pointed out, it’s a miracle that he’s alive. “I expected to be dead when I was about 30. Hehehehe!” His high-pitched giggle is surprising – as is so much about him. Crosby’s life story would make an incredible, if possibly unbelievable, movie. He grew up in Los Angeles, the privileged son of the Oscar-winning cinematographer Floyd Crosby. His mother doted on him, his father was as cold as he was brilliant. He flunked school, briefly studied drama then pursued a career in music. Crosby had huge success with two seminal bands. The Byrds pretty much invented folk rock in the 1960s with their jingly-jangly pop (covers of Bob Dylan’s Mr Tambourine Man and Pete Seeger’s Turn! Turn! Turn! were No 1 hits). After Crosby was sacked from the Byrds, he joined forces with Graham Nash from the Hollies and Stephen Stills from Buffalo Springfield to form Crosby, Stills & Nash (CSN), one of the first supergroups. With Neil Young , they became a super-supergroup. All four were exceptional singer-songwriters, their harmonies as gorgeous as they were intricate, and, when they wanted to, they could rock with the best of them. Their first two albums, the eponymous debut and (with Young) Déjà Vu, sold millions and produced any number of classic songs including Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, Our House, Helpless, Marrakesh Express, Guinnevere, Long Time Gone and Almost Cut My Hair (the last three written by Crosby). Both the Byrds and CSN have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. View image in fullscreen']...\n"

By Matthew Frankel, CFP – Updated Dec 6, 2023 at 10:30AM The price-to-earnings ratio, also known as the P/E ratio, is one of the most commonly used stock valuation metrics, and it is important for any investor to understand. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at what the P/E ratio is, how to calculate it, and how to use it as part of your investment analysis. Image source: The Motley Fool Understanding the P/E ratio Understanding the P/E ratio The P/E ratio, or price-to-earnings ratio, is a metric that compares a company’s net income to its stock price. It can be an excellent tool when analyzing stocks and can help investors get a sense of whether a stock is a good value or expensive. As the name implies, the P/E ratio is calculated by taking the current share price of a stock and dividing by its earnings per share over a one-year period. For example, if a stock trades for $40 per share and earned $2 per share in the past year, its P/E ratio would be 20. You may hear the P/E ratio also referred to as the P/E multiple or earnings multiple, and it’s important to realize that these terms are often used interchangeably and mean the same thing. There are several different ways to calculate the P/E ratio, with the two most common being the trailing P/E and the forward P/E. A stock’s trailing P/E is calculated by using its past four quarters’ earnings, while the forward P/E is calculated by using the consensus projections, or the company’s own guidance, for the next 12 months of earnings. Why is it important?', \"In some countries, like Japan, it can be a lot less. In most countries, the difference is not so extreme, but it is still there. So P/E ratios tend to be higher than they would be if we were using net earnings instead of reported earnings. P/E ratio stands for the price to earnings ratio. Many people in the stock market use P/E because it shows how much you are paying for a dollar of profit. How is PE Ratio calculated? The PE ratio is calculated by dividing the market price of a share by its earnings per share. The result is then multiplied by 100. A PE ratio of 8, for example, means that for every rupee of profit earned by the company, the shares are being sold at 8 rupees. A PE ratio of 15 means it's being sold at 15 rupees for every rupee of profit. E.g., if the PE Ratio of TCS is ten, it means that the current market price of TCS is ten times its EPS. The PE ratio of a company tells us at what price investors are buying or selling the company's shares. The higher the PE ratio of a company, the more expensive it is for investors to buy shares, so you can say that if the PE ratio of a company increases, then the value of its shares will also increase. On the other hand, if the PE ratio of a company decreases, then its share value will also decrease because investors are finding it cheaper to purchase more shares, given that they are paying less money for each share. How to determine the PE Ratio? There are two ways to find out what the PE ratio is. You can look it up in a reference book, or you can\", \"How To Understand The P/E Ratio Rob Berger Editor Published: May 4, 2022, 9:59am Editorial Note: Forbes Advisor may earn a commission on sales made from partner links on this page, but that doesn't affect our editors' opinions or evaluations. The price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio, helps you compare the price of a company’s stock to the earnings the company generates. This comparison helps you understand whether markets are overvaluing or undervaluing a stock. The P/E ratio is a key tool to help you compare the valuations of individual stocks or entire stock indexes, such as the S&P 500. In this article, we’ll explore the P/E ratio in depth, learn how to calculate a P/E ratio, and understand how it can help you make sound investment decisions. What Is the P/E Ratio? The P/E ratio is derived by dividing the price of a stock by the stock’s earnings. Think of it this way: The market price of a stock tells you how much people are willing to pay to own the shares, but the P/E ratio tells you whether the price accurately reflects the company’s earnings potential, or it’s value over time. If a company’s stock is trading at INR 100 per share, for example, and the company generates INR 4 per share in annual earnings, the P/E ratio of the company’s stock would be INR 25 (100 / 4). To put it another way, given the company’s current earnings, it would take 25 years of accumulated earnings to equal the cost of the investment. In addition to stocks, the P/E ratio is calculated for entire stock indexes. For example, the P/E ratio of the NIFTY 50 currently stands at 22.20 . Since prices fluctuate constantly, the P/E ratio of stocks and stock indexes never stand still. The P/E ratio\"]...\n"

The market cap is the value of all of the company’s stock combined, giving you a sense of what value investors are placing on the company based on the price it is trading at. Investing for Everyone As of February of 2023, Coca-Cola had a market cap of $259.46 billion whereas Pepsi had a market cap of $243.17 billion. These projections fluctuate.

      "[INFO] Chunks: ['\"the monthly dividend company.\" Realty Income has paid a dividend every month for over 600 consecutive months, and is now a Dividend Aristocrat. On rare occasions a company may issue what\\'s known as a special dividend. Often this is the result of a large asset sale or some other event that results in a large nonrecurring profit, while other companies use a special dividend to return extra money to shareholders every few years. A notable example is Costco Wholesale ( COST 0.07% ), which has paid substantial special dividends three times over the past decade, in addition to its regular quarterly dividend: COST Dividend data by YCharts Important dividend dates to know Important dividend dates to know There are three important dates to understand if you invest in any dividend stocks : The ex-dividend date is the first day a stock trades without the most recent dividend being factored into the share price. In other words, if you buy shares on or after this date, you will not get the next dividend the company is scheduled to pay. The payment date is the date a company will make the next dividend payment to shareholders. This may or may not be the date that the dividend arrives in your account; depending on the brokerage you use, there could be a delay of a day or more in getting your dividend payment. The payment date can range from just a few days to more than a month after the board of directors declares a dividend is coming. The record date is the date you must own shares on or before in order to be entitled to the dividend. When do you have to buy a stock to get paid the next dividend? When do you have to buy a stock to get', \"5, 2023. The company previously declared the dividend Feb. 19, 2023, and the record date was set as May 6, 2023. Only shareholders who had purchased the stock before the ex-date, therefore, are entitled to the cash payment. Other Considerations On average, a stock often will drop slightly less than the dividend amount. Given that stock prices move on a daily basis, the fluctuation caused by small dividends may be difficult to detect. The effect on stocks from larger dividend payments can be easier to observe. If a company issues a dividend in stock instead of cash or the cash dividend is 25% or more of the value of the stock, the ex-date rules slightly differ. With a stock or large cash dividend, the ex-date is set on the first business day after the dividend is paid. Key Dividend-Related Dates The ex-date is just one of the important dates in dividend distribution. Declaration date: Also known as the announcement date, this is the date when a company's board of directors announces the dividend distribution. This is an important moment: any change in the expected dividend can cause the stock to rise or fall quickly as traders adjust their expectations. The ex-date and record date will occur after the declaration date. Record date: This is when the company reviews who the shareholders of record are. The record date is one business day after the ex-date but shouldn't be a major factor in your decision of when to buy a stock. Payment date: This is when dividend checks are sent or credited to investor accounts. Since the payment date is known in advance, the event shouldn't have any impact on the stock price. Who Sets the Ex-Date? A record date is set first. Then, the ex-dividend date is set based on the\", \"or after the ex-dividend date , the seller of the stock keeps the dividend. Record Date (or Date of Record) This is the date that you must be on the company's books as a shareholder of record to receive the dividend. Payment Date This is the scheduled date on which a company will pay a declared dividend to shareholders of record. Hypothetical Example – Company ABC On August 15, Company ABC declares a dividend payable on September 28 to its shareholders. Details stipulate that shareholders of record on the company's books on or before September 6 are entitled to the dividend. The stock would go ex-dividend one business day before the record date. The table below puts it together with the key dates: Type Declaration Date Ex-Dividend Date Record Date Payment Date Date August 15 September 5 September 6 September 28 Note The date the dividend is announced The date before which you must own the stock to be entitled to the dividend. The date by which you must be on the company's books as a shareholder to receive the dividend. The date the dividend is paid to shareholders. Dividend Yield This is the percentage of return a company pays out annually in dividends relative to its share price. Not all companies pay a dividend, so the presence of a dividend yield on a stock quote screen can often be viewed positively - as only profitable companies tend to share their earnings. A stock's dividend yield is calculated by taking its annual dividend-per-share and then dividing it by the stock's current price. The result is then expressed as a percentage. The formula is: Dividend yield = annual dividend / stock price x 100 As an example, Company ABC pays an annual dividend of $1.44, and the stock is trading at\"]...\n"

However, if you only have room for one in your portfolio, you\\'ll need to know the better buy. Apple Apple shares are up by 274% over the last five years and 890% over the last decade. That growth has come alongside annual revenues, which have risen by 48% to $394 billion since 2018 while operating income increased by 68% to $119 billion. The company\\'s development over the years is owed mainly to the potency of its products and services, which has led it to achieve a leading 24% global market share in smartphones with the iPhone. Its market share has steadily grown from 11.7% in the first quarter of 2019. The company famously has created a \"walled garden\" of products, which includes smartphones, computers, tablets, smartwatches, and headphones, all of which are interconnected and all of which rely on its in-house operating systems. The interconnectivity of these devices gives users of Apple devices incentives to stay within its ecosystem when seeking out others devices and services. For instance, when an iPhone user needs a computer, they are far more likely to turn to Apple\\'s Mac lineup than its competitor\\'s, thanks to the connectivity\\'s ease of use. For this reason, Apple was the only company among its biggest competitors to experience growth in its PC business amid economic headwinds in Q3 2022, expanding by 40.2%.

That being said... MDMA (aka molly, ecstasy, E) has had something of an onscreen renaissance in recent years.

All of a sudden, characters left and right are poppin\\' molly like frat boys at a Tiësto concert, and the drug\\'s consumption is just as likely to yield an epic dance-off, a sweaty make-out, or a rapid-fire party montage as it is to serve as cautionary tale.

Friendly, uninhibited, and irresponsible in his blatant desire to be hip with his son, Scott goes so far as to encourage his two other children to experiment with Ecstasy, alcohol, marijuana, and LSD during an all-night party at his apartment. Eventually, Scott's ex-wife intervenes on behalf of the children and the viewer is witness to his downward spiral, including an arrest for drug possession, an ugly custody battle, and several emotionally draining family confrontations.

It is believed that Neeson will play the son of officer Frank Drebin , the character played in the original by Leslie Nielsen in the 80s comedy classic series. See full article at Collider.com 10/13/2022 by Christopher McPherson Collider.com Naked Gun Reboot With Liam Neeson Coming From Lonely Island\\'s Akiva Schaffer Nobody could possibly top the late comedy legend Leslie Nielsen and his performance in the classic 1988 film \" The Naked Gun ,\" but when has a little thing like that ever stopped this industry from trying anyway? With several recent legacy sequels and reboots proving successful at the box office in the post-pandemic landscape, Paramount is moving forward with yet another one of their own. Renowned among viewers of a certain vintage for its slapstick, laugh-a-minute joys that rival the likes of \" Airplane! \" or \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\" the original \" The Naked Gun \" is now being brought back with with actor Liam Neeson negotiating to star. This news comes courtesy of Deadline, which reports that \"The Lonely Island\" veteran Akiva Schaffer is on board to direct the project alongside screenwriters Dan Gregor and Doug Mand (\" Chip \\'n Dale: Rescue Rangers \"),', 'of \\'Naked Gun\\' Movies Dies at Age 84 By Bob Thomas , Andrew Dalton | Last Updated: August 15, 2012 LOS ANGELES – Leslie Nielsen, who traded in his dramatic persona for inspired bumbling as a hapless doctor in \"Airplane!\" and the accident-prone detective Frank Drebin in \"The Naked Gun\" comedies, died on Sunday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 84. The Canadian-born actor died from complications from pneumonia at a hospital near his home at 5:34 p.m., surrounded by his wife, Barbaree, and friends, his agent John S. Kelly said in a statement. \"We are saddened by the passing of beloved actor Leslie Nielsen, probably best remembered as Lt. Frank Drebin in \\'The Naked Gun\\' series of pictures, but who enjoyed a more than 60-year career in motion pictures and television,\" said Kelly. Nielsen came to Hollywood in the mid-1950s after performing in 150 live television dramas in New York. With a craggily handsome face, blond hair and 6-foot-2 height, he seemed ideal for a movie leading man. Nielsen first performed as the king of France in the Paramount operetta \"The Vagabond King\" with Kathryn Grayson. The film — he called it \"The Vagabond Turkey\" — flopped, but MGM signed him to a seven-year contract. His first film for that studio was auspicious — as the space ship commander in the science fiction classic \"Forbidden Planet.\" He found his best dramatic role as the captain of an overturned ocean liner in the 1972 disaster movie, \"The Poseidon Adventure.\" He became known as a serious actor, although behind the camera he was a prankster. That was an aspect of his personality never exploited, however, until \"Airplane!\" was released in 1980 and became a huge hit. As the doctor aboard a plane in which the pilots, and some of the passengers,', 'fans among the younger generation for inane non sequiturs delivered with a straight face. \"Can you fly this plane, and land it?\" he asks a passenger. \"Surely, you can\\'t be serious,\" comes the answer. \"I am serious. And don\\'t call me Shirley,\" Rumack replies. The Naked Gun franchise had its origins in the short-lived 1982 TV show Police Squad. After it was cancelled, creators Jim Abrahams, Jerry Zucker and David Zucker – who had previously worked with Nielsen on Airplane! – turned it into a feature packed with slapstick action and double entendres. Drebin beat up the Ayatollah Khomeini and scrubbed the birthmark from Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev\\'s head. The cast was rounded out by George Kennedy as Drebin\\'s partner, and OJ Simpson as their hapless colleague. In the 1991 sequel, Naked Gun 2-1/2: The Smell of Fear, the villain, played by Robert Goulet, tells an unannounced Drebin he did not see his name on the guestlist. \"Nothing to be embarrassed about. I sometimes go by my maiden name,\" Drebin replies. The final film, 1994\\'s The Naked Gun 33-1/3: The Final Insult saw Drebin try to avert a disaster during the Academy Awards and go undercover in a penitentiary.

      "[INFO] Chunks: ['Hollywood can muster to lure audiences back into theaters. After all, fewer experiences are better realized on the big screen than a sprawling battle sequence or explosive, stunt-packed chase scene. There may even come a time where movie theaters more or less exclusively exhibit action movies, while less extravagant fare heads straight to streaming. Whether that\\'s good news or terrible news probably depends on who\\'s being asked. From epic swashbucklers to the cream of the comic book crop, Stacker compiled data on all action movies to come up with a Stacker score—a weighted index split evenly between IMDb and Metacritic scores. To qualify, the film had to have an \"action\" listing on IMDb, a Metascore, and at least 5,000 votes. Ties were broken by Metascore, and further ties were broken by IMDb user ratings. All data is accurate as of Jan. 11, 2021. Starting with the great, counting down to the greater, and ending with the greatest, here are the 100 best action movies of all time. #100. 3:10 to Yuma (2007) - Director: James Mangold - Stacker score: 83.2 - Metascore: 76 - IMDb user rating: 7.7 - Runtime: 122 minutes An Elmore Leonard short story provided the basis for both a 1957 Western and this action-packed remake. Christian Bale plays rancher Dan Evans, who must escort wanted outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to justice. Many scenes were shot at New Mexico’s Bonanza Creek Ranch, which has been used for a number of classic Westerns. #99. King Kong (2005) - Director: Peter Jackson - Stacker score: 83.2 - Metascore: 81 - IMDb user rating: 7.2 - Runtime: 187 minutes Director Peter Jackson followed his acclaimed “Lord of the Rings” trilogy with yet another big-budget blockbuster.

The story traces draft after draft of the screenplay’s development, including screenwriter Howard Koch’s addition of Rick’s background as a gunrunner during the Spanish Civil War. Years later, Koch wrote a treatment for a sequel called Return to Casablanca , set in the 1960s, in which the son of Rick and Ilse—raised by Ilse and Victor Laszlo—visits the North African town where he was conceived the night his mother, gun in hand, demanded a letter of transport from his biological dad. The studios passed on Koch’s story, perhaps fearing that it would fare no better than the 1955 and 1983 TV versions of the classic film that had come and quickly gone.

Almost 35 million people watched the comedy unfold in the hospital, which featured a special guest appearance of Janice. 2. “The Last One” (Season 10, Episodes 17 and 18) Many people probably thought the series finale of Friends was the most watched episode for the series. However, it only comes in at number 2 with 52.46 million fans tuning in to watch Rachel get off the plane and Monica and Chandler becoming parents. The closing moment when the gang goes and gets their last cup of coffee still brings a tear to my eye. 1. “The One After the Super Bowl” (Season 2, Episodes 12 and 13) It is pretty clear that season two was the most watched of all the seasons of Friends. The two-part episode that aired after the Super Bowl in 1996 is the most watched episode for the classic comedy. 52.9 million people watched as Chandler hooked up with Julia Roberts, Joey was stalked Brooke Shields, and Monica and Rachel fought over Jean Claude Van Damme.

The series finale was NOT the show’s most watched episode. The Friends finale stands at #4 of the most watched series finales, behind M*A*S*H, Cheers and Seinfeld , but even with 52.5 million viewers, it still didn’t break its own record of 52.9 million viewers that “The One After The Superbowl” generated in 1996 . 9. Friends and former cast members were backstage during the final taping. Hank Azaria , Phoebe’s scientist boyfriend, was at the show’s final taping as was Courtney Cox’s then-husband, David Arquette, who filmed the cast backstage before the taping began. 10. Friends took a cue from Pearl Jam. If you’ve ever been to a Pearl Jam concert, chances are the last song of the night was “Yellow Ledbetter,” this isn’t always the case, but more often than not, it’s the band’s closing number. Which could be why showrunners , David Crane and Marta Kauffman, chose to use it in the finale’s second half when Rachel goes through the gate at the airport. This was also the first time the band had licensed out a song for a television show.

      "[INFO] Chunks: ['Science & Tech Key People: William Thomson, Baron Kelvin Hans Bethe Lev Davidovich Landau Lyman Spitzer James Prescott Joule (Show more) Related Topics: combustion geothermal energy solar energy wind power electric power (Show more) On the Web: Cal Poly Pomona - Energy and Energy Transfer - Content Background Document (Feb. 27, 2024) (Show more) See all related content → Top Questions What is energy? Energy is the capacity for doing work. It may exist in potential, kinetic, thermal, helectrical, chemical, nuclear, or other forms. What is the unit of measurement for energy? In the International System of Units (SI), energy is measured in joules . One joule is equal to the work done by a one-newton force acting over a one-meter distance. Can energy be created? Energy can be neither created nor destroyed. It can only be changed from one form to another. This principle is known as the conservation of energy . energy , in physics , the capacity for doing work . It may exist in potential , kinetic , thermal , electrical, chemical , nuclear , or other various forms. There are, moreover, heat and work—i.e., energy in the process of transfer from one body to another. After it has been transferred, energy is always designated according to its nature. Hence, heat transferred may become thermal energy, while work done may manifest itself in the form of mechanical energy . All forms of energy are associated with motion . For example, any given body has kinetic energy if it is in motion. A tensioned device such as a bow or spring , though at rest, has the potential for creating motion; it contains potential energy because of its configuration. Similarly, nuclear energy is potential energy because it results from the configuration of subatomic particles in the nucleus', '& Advocacy › Reports & Studies › POPA Reports › Background Papers on Energy › Energy Units Energy Units Introduction Many sorts of units are used in energy discussions. They fall into two broad categories: (a) those whose definition is not related to a particular fuel, which we here term \"basic\" units; and (b) those whose definition is related to idealized properties of a specific fuel, which we here term \"source-based\" units. These units, along with special topics related to electricity, are discussed in succeeding sections. Table 1 gives conversion factors between units, as well as the energy content of specific fuels. Basic Units Joule (J). This is the basic energy unit of the metric system, or in a later more comprehensive formulation, the International System of Units (SI). It is ultimately defined in terms of the meter, kilogram, and second. Calorie (cal). Historically the calorie was defined in terms of the heating of water. Thus, in a traditional definition, one calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1°C, from 14.5 °C to 15.5 °C. (This is sometimes referred to as the 15 °C calorie, and differs slightly from the \"calorie\" measured for other temperature intervals.) More recently the calorie has been defined in terms of the joule; the equivalence between the calorie and joule is historically known as the mechanical equivalent of heat. Several definitions of the calorie are now in common use, including (2): thermochemical calorie 1 cal = 4.184 J (exact) 15 °C calorie 1 cal = 4.1858 J International Table calorie 1 cal = 4.1868 J (exact) mean calorie 1 cal = 4.1900 J The International Table (IT) calorie has been adopted in the publications of the Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy', 'the joule (symbol J) is the unit of energy. It is not frequently used outside of the scientific community in the United States, but it is in other countries. In the United States, for example, the energy content of a food product is most frequently stated in food calories. This energy can be represented in joules, as it is in many places of the world. In Australia, a Diet Coca Cola is labelled Low Joule rather than Low Cal, as it is in the United States. Measurement of Energy Scientists have examined energy and power in a variety of ways over the years. As a result, each sort of energy – electrical, mechanical, chemical, thermal, and nuclear – developed its own measurement method, and almost every energy relevant sector evolved its own vocabulary- for example, car salespeople when discussing horsepower. Tons and BTUs are installed by HVAC contractors. Kilowatt-hours are delivered by electric utilities. Newtons and joules are terms used by scientists. The International System of Units (SI) was established from the metric system in 1960 to offer a uniform language for all physical entities. The SI is based on seven base units, from which all other physical values may be calculated. A newton (derived unit of force), for example, is stated as 1 kilogram (base unit of mass) accelerated at one metre (base unit of length) per second (base unit of time) squared. We also have some multiples and fractions of units. A megawatt (MW), for example, is one million (10 6 ) watts; a milliwatt (mW) is one-thousandth (10 -3 ) of a watt. Although the energy industry is beginning to utilise SI language, conventional terminologies continue to predominate. Many automobile manufacturers now indicate engine power in kilowatts, but in parentheses following the horsepower rating: 187 hp (140']...\n"

      "[INFO] Query: what kind of tigers are extinct?...\n",
      "[INFO] Chunks: [\"ate a variety of mammals, including deer, wild pigs , and mountain sheep. Little is known about their behavior in the wild, though human hunters frequently took advantage of their meat-eating habits to trap and kill these incredible creatures. Far more is known about what killed Caspian tigers off. Namely, overhunting by humans, loss of habitat to agricultural needs, and the loss of game animals. How Many Types of Tigers are Left? Less than 3,000 tigers currently live in the wild ©iStock.com/ANDREYGUDKOV Today, science recognizes two official species of the tiger: the continental tiger, and the Sunda island tiger. However, in the past scientists classified as many as nine types of tigers, three of which are now extinct. One more subspecies, the South China tiger , is considered functionally extinct, as no live specimen has been seen in over ten years. Tiger Conservation: What You Can Do Today, fewer than 3,000 tigers live in the wild, occupying under 4% of their historic ranges. All subspecies are either Critically Endangered or functionally extinct. One of the biggest threats to their continued existence is the black market trade in exotic animals and exotic animal parts. Habitat loss and fragmentation are also threats to our few remaining tigers. The first step in protecting tigers is to educate yourself on why these creatures are so important and what can be done to save them.

Tiger Quiz - 6,206 People Couldn't Ace This Quiz Watch The Heart-Stopping Moment When This\", 'Extinct References Overview of Tigers The tiger is considered to be one of the few animal species that has striped fur (aside from zebras). Such color allows them to blend with their environment and easily attack their potential prey. Interestingly enough, these stripes would still be seen on the skin even if the fur is shaved. During hunting, these cats rely mostly on their sense of sight and hearing rather than a sense of smell. Tigers are solitary and prefer to hunt alone. And like most animals, they prefer larger territories to which they mark using their urine, feces, and vocalizations. An average female tiger gives birth to two to four young (called cubs ) every two years. If ever all these cubs die at a single time, the female tiger can produce again after five months. There were originally nine subspecies of the species Pathera tigris , but only six of them are remaining now. See endangered tiger species section below for more details. However, due to various reasons, three of them had already gone extinct, with an average of one per twenty years. Why Are Tigers Endangered? Countless reasons, mostly man-made, are responsible for the continuing decrease in the number of tigers. These reasons include habitat loss, climate change, illegal poaching, and retaliatory killings. They are explained below: 1.

At the start of the 20 th century, there were 100,000 tigers in the wild. Now between 3,000 and 4,000 tigers remain due to hunting and habitat loss.

This is enough time for genetic differences to arise but not enough time for them to look really different from each other. Nine subspecies are genetically justified and recognized. Three subspecies are extinct already and the other six tiger subspecies are classified as endangered by the IUCN.

Bengal tigers are the second largest tiger subspecies and enjoy eating pigs, deer, and other hoofed animals. They live in grasslands, subtropical and tropical rainforests, deciduous forests, and mangroves. Perhaps one reason that they have survived is that they don’t need much space compared to other tigers; about 18 tigers can live in 100 square km (39 square miles). The Golden Tabby Bengal tiger.
